  "README.md": "# LSUN\n\n## Data Release\n\nAll the images in one category are stored in one lmdb database\nfile. The value\n of each entry is the jpg binary data. We resize all the images so\n that the\n  smaller dimension is 256 and compress the images in jpeg with\n  quality 75.\n  \n### Citing LSUN\n\nIf you find LSUN dataset useful in your research, please consider citing:\n\n    @article{yu15lsun,\n        Author = {Yu, Fisher and Zhang, Yinda and Song, Shuran and Seff, Ari and Xiao, Jianxiong},\n        Title = {LSUN: Construction of a Large-scale Image Dataset using Deep Learning with Humans in the Loop},\n        Journal = {arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.03365},\n        Year = {2015}\n    }\n\n### Download data\nPlease make sure you have cURL installed\n```bash\n# Download the whole latest data set\npython2.7 download.py\n# Download the whole latest data set to <data_dir>\npython2.7 download.py -o <data_dir>\n# Download data for bedroom\npython2.7 download.py -c bedroom\n# Download testing set\npython2.7 download.py -c test\n```\n\n## Demo code\n\n### Dependency\n\nInstall Python\n\nInstall Python dependency: numpy, lmdb, opencv\n\n### Usage:\n\nView the lmdb content\n\n```bash\npython2.7 data.py view <image db path>\n```\n\nExport the images to a folder\n\n```bash\npython2.7 data.py export <image db path> --out_dir <output directory>\n```\n\n### Example:\n\nExport all the images in valuation sets in the current folder to a\n\"data\"\nsubfolder.\n\n```bash\npython2.7 data.py export *_val_lmdb --out_dir data\n```\n\n## Submission\n\nWe expect one category prediction for each image in the testing\nset. The name of each image is the key value in the LMDB\ndatabase. Each category has an index as listed in\n[index list](https://github.com/fyu/lsun_toolkit/blob/master/category_indices.txt). The\nsubmitted results on the testing set will be stored in a text file\nwith one line per image. In each line, there are two fields separated\nby a whitespace. The first is the image key and the second is the\npredicted category index. For example:\n\n```\n0001c44e5f5175a7e6358d207660f971d90abaf4 0\n000319b73404935eec40ac49d1865ce197b3a553 1\n00038e8b13a97577ada8a884702d607220ce6d15 2\n00039ba1bf659c30e50b757280efd5eba6fc2fe1 3\n...\n```\n\nThe score for the submission is the percentage of correctly predicted\nlabels. In our evaluation, we will double check our ground truth\nlabels for the testing images and we may remove some images with\ncontroversial labels in the final evaluation.\n",
