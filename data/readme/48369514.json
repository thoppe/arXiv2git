  "README.md": "# perforated-cnn-matconvnet\n\nPerforatedCNNs accelerate convolutional neural networks (CNNs) by skipping evaluation of the convolutional layers in some of the spatial positions. See the paper for more details:\n\nMichael Figurnov, Dmitry Vetrov, Pushmeet Kohli. PerforatedCNNs: Acceleration through Elimination of Redundant Convolutions. _Under review as a conference paper at ICLR 2016_ [[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.08362)].\n\nThe code is based on MatConvNet from December 2014, with some backports (such as more aggressive memory savings for ReLU).\n\nSee also [Caffe](https://github.com/mfigurnov/perforated-cnn-caffe) implementation of PerforatedCNNs.\n\n## Installation\n\nClone the repository, run MATLAB, go to `acceleration` directory. Compile the code:\n\n```matlab\nsetup;\nvl_compilenn('enableGpu', true, 'enableImReadJpeg', true);\n```\n\nRun some tests:\n\n```matlab\nvl_test_nnconv_perf(0); vl_test_nnconv_perf(1);\nvl_test_nnpool_fast(0); vl_test_nnpool_fast(1);\n```\n\n## Experiment: perforation of whole network\n\nSee sections 3.3 and 4.3 of the paper for details.\n\nDownload `.mat` files with network weights and CIFAR-10 dataset from [here](https://yadi.sk/d/4NWM-lb3mca5G). Put them into the root folder.\nNavigate into `acceleration` directory. There is a script per network:\n\n1. Network in Network for CIFAR-10: `cifar_greedy_perforation`\n2. AlexNet: `alexnet_greedy_perforation`\n3. VGG-16: `vgg_greedy_perforation`\n\nSet `dataDir` path in the AlexNet and VGG-16 scripts if you want to build perforated networks for ImageNet.\nChange the `useGpuTimings` setting to select the target device for a perforated network (CPU or GPU).\nExample:\n```matlab\nsetup;\ncifar_greedy_perforation('useGpuTimings', true);\n```\n\n## MatConvNet's original README\n\n**MatConvNet** is a MATLAB toolbox implementing *Convolutional Neural\nNetworks* (CNNs) for computer vision applications. It is simple,\nefficient, and can run and learn state-of-the-art CNNs. Several\nexample CNNs are included to classify and encode images.
