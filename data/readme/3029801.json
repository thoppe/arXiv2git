  "README": "Sudoku_CPP is a console based Sudoku game I wrote in 2008 after taking CS161, it doesn't use ncurses \nor something sophisticated, it just clears the screen and prints the current state of the program. \nIt's iostream based.\n\nI'll have to learn ncurses before I can make this better, for now, you can pretend it's 1985.\n\nUpdate (Sat Jan  7 20:06:26 PST 2012):\n    It was announced recently on Technology Review's arXiv Blog that the problem of the \n    minimum number of initial values (clues) in a sudoku grid required for the grid to \n    have a unique solution is 17. \n    \n    For more details, see here: http://arxiv.org/abs/1201.0749  \n\n    This re-kindled my interest in this sudoku program I wrote a few years back. I intended \n    it to be a solver, but it ended up being only a live terminal game. I am going to make \n    a solver, and it will require 17 initial values (with a random choice option)\n\nGoals:\n  Implement a solver (17 clues required) \n  Implement a front-end, using ncurses or something not console based.\n  Make more Object Oriented\n   (for Grid class)\n    - Remove cursor member and make into parameter, this is more \n      convenient for automated solving algorithms\n    - Remove print function and return an ostream object reference\n  Make functional version (just for fun)\n",
