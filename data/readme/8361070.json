E. Carrillo, J. D. McEwen, D. Van De Ville, J.-P. Thiran,\n    and Y. Wiaux.  \"Sparsity averaging for compressive imaging\", IEEE\n    Signal Processing Letters, Vol. 20, No. 6, pp. 591-594, 2013\n    (arXiv:1208.2330).\n\nAUTHORS\n  R. E. Carrillo (http://people.epfl.ch/rafael.carrillo)\n  J. D. McEwen (http://www.jasonmcewen.org)\n  Y. Wiaux (http://basp.eps.hw.ac.uk)\n\nEXPERIMENTS\n  To run an in-painting reconstruction example, run the\n  script sopt_demo1 in the bin folder.\n\n  To run a Fourier sampling reconstruction example, run the\n  script sopt_demo2 in the bin folder.\n\nREFERENCES\n  When referencing this code, please cite our related paper:\n    [1] R. E. Carrillo, J. D. McEwen, D. Van De Ville, J.-P. Thiran,\n    and Y.

Before compiling you \n  might need to edit the makefile to specify your compiler and the \n  location where the dependencies are installed. Once these are \n  installed you just need to type\n\n  %make all\n\n  to install the toolbox. \n\nSUPPORT\n  If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact Rafael\n  Carrillo at: rafael {DOT} carrillo {AT} epfl {DOT} ch.\n\nNOTES\n  The code is given for educational purpose. For\n  the matlab version of the code see the folder matlab.\n\nLICENSE\n  SOPT: Sparse OPTimisation package\n  Copyright (C) 2013 Rafael Carrillo, Jason McEwen, \n  Yves Wiaux\n\n  This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\n  modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as\n  published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the\n  License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\n  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but\n  WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
