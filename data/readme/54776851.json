  "README.md": "# caffe-SSDH\n\nBy [Zexi Han](http://liamhancs.weebly.com).\n\nNational Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR) at the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).\n\n## Introduction\n\ncaffe-SSDH updates the caffe version of [Caffe-DeepBinaryCode](https://github.com/kevinlin311tw/Caffe-DeepBinaryCode). Now it supports the experiments with the latest batch normalization and [Deep Residual Networks](https://github.com/KaimingHe/deep-residual-networks). \n\nWe made tests on the dataset from Alibaba Large-scale Image Search Challenge with SSDH approach, which contains 5 million product images, but the performance was not as good as Kevin's experiment on CIFAR-10 dataset. It should have worked better theoretically. In the future work, I will make improvements on the original SSDH and update it here.\n\n## Alibaba Large-scale Image Search Challenge\n\n0.

SSDH constructs hash functions as a latent layer in a deep network and the binary codes are learned by minimizing an objective function defined over classification error and other desirable hash codes properties. Compared to state-of-the-art results, SSDH achieves 26.30% (89.68% vs. 63.38%), 17.11% (89.00% vs. 71.89%) and 19.56% (31.28% vs. 11.72%) higher precisions averaged over a different number of top returned images for the CIFAR-10, NUS-WIDE, and SUN397 datasets, respectively.\n\n<img src=\"https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~r01944012/ssdh_intro.png\" width=\"800\">\n\nThe details can be found in the following [arXiv preprint.](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00101)\nPresentation slide can be found [here](http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~r01944012/deepworkshop-slide.pdf)\n\n\n## Citing the deep hashing work\n\nIf you find our work useful in your research, please consider citing:\n\n    Supervised Learning of Semantics-Preserving Hashing via Deep Neural Networks for Large-Scale Image Search\n    Huei-Fang Yang, Kevin Lin, Chu-Song Chen\n    arXiv preprint arXiv:1507.00101\n\n\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n  0. MATLAB (tested with 2012b on 64-bit Linux)\n  0. Caffe's [prerequisites](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html#prequequisites)\n\n\n## Install Caffe-DeepBinaryCode\n\nAdjust Makefile.config and simply run the following commands:\n\n    $ make all -j8\n    $ make test -j8\n    $ make matcaffe\n    $ ./prepare.sh\n\nFor a faster build, compile in parallel by doing `make all -j8` where 8 is the number of parallel threads for compilation (a good choice for the number of threads is the number of cores in your machine).\n\n## Demo\n \nLaunch matlab and run `demo.m`. This demo will generate 48-bits binary codes for each image using the proposed SSDH.\n    \n    >> demo\n\n\n<img src=\"https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~r01944012/ssdh_demo.png\" width=\"350\">\n\n\n## Retrieval evaluation on CIFAR10\n\nLaunch matalb and run `run_cifar10.m` to perform the evaluation of `precision at k` and `mean average precision at k`. We set `k=1000` in the experiments. The bit length of binary codes is `48`. This process takes around 12 minutes.\n    \n    >> run_cifar10\n\n\nThen, you will get the `mAP` result as follows. \n\n    >> MAP = 0.899731\n\nMoreover, simply run the following commands to generate the `precision at k` curves:\n\n    $ cd analysis\n    $ gnuplot plot-p-at-k.gnuplot \n\nYou will reproduce the precision curves with respect to different number of top retrieved samples when the 48-bit hash codes are\nused in the evaluation.\n \n## Train SSDH on CIFAR10\n\nSimply run the following command to train SSDH:\n\n\n    $ ./examples/SSDH/train.sh\n\n\nAfter 50,000 iterations, the top-1 error is 9.7% on the test set of CIFAR10 dataset:\n```\nI0107 19:24:32.258903 23945 solver.cpp:326] Iteration 50000, loss = 0.0274982\nI0107 19:24:32.259012 23945 solver.cpp:346] Iteration 50000, Testing net (#0)\nI0107 19:24:36.696506 23945 solver.cpp:414]     Test net output #0: accuracy = 0.903125\nI0107 19:24:36.696543 23945 solver.cpp:414]     Test net output #1: loss: 50%-fire-rate = 1.47562e-06 (* 1 = 1.47562e-06 loss)\nI0107 19:24:36.696552 23945 solver.cpp:414]     Test net output #2: loss: classfication-error = 0.332657 (* 1 = 0.332657 loss)\nI0107 19:24:36.696559 23945 solver.cpp:414]     Test net output #3: loss: forcing-binary = -0.00317774 (* 1 = -0.00317774 loss)\nI0107 19:24:36.696565 23945 solver.cpp:331] Optimization Done.\nI0107 19:24:36.696570 23945 caffe.cpp:214] Optimization Done.\n```\n\nThe training process takes roughly 2~3 hours on a desktop with Titian X GPU. You will finally get your model named `SSDH48_iter_xxxxxx.caffemodel` under folder `/examples/SSDH/`\n\nTo use the model, modify the `model_file` in `demo.m` to link to your model:\n\n```\n    model_file = './YOUR/MODEL/PATH/filename.caffemodel';\n```\n\nLaunch matlab, run `demo.m` and enjoy!\n    \n    >> demo\n\n## Train SSDH on another dataset\n\nIt should be easy to train the model using another dataset as long as that dataset has label annotations.\n \n  0. Convert your training/test set into leveldb/lmdb format using `create_imagenet.sh`.\n  0. Modify the `source` in `/example/SSDH/train_val.prototxt` to link to your training/test set.\n  0. Run `./examples/SSDH/train.sh`, and start training on your dataset.\n\n\n## Resources\n\n**Note**: This documentation may contain links to third party websites, which are provided for your convenience only.
