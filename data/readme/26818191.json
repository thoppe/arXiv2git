  "README.org": "#+TITLE: README for Fast Forward Feature Selection\n#+AUTHOR: Mathieu Fauvel\n#+EMAIL: mathieu.fauvel@ensat.fr\n\n* Objectives\n  The  package provides  the python  codes to  perform a  fast forward\n  feature selection using a Gaussian  Mixture Model.  The algorithm is\n  based  on the  following papers  [[http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00857]] and\n  [[http://fauvel.mathieu.free.fr/data/ffs_gmm.pdf][Nonlinear parsimonious  feature selection for the  classification of\n  hyperspectral images]].\n\n* Install\n  Just download the  file ~npfs.py~ and import it with  python. It has\n  been tested on linux, Debian Wheezy.\n\n* Requirements\n  Scipy needs  to be installed. For  a fast processing, a  good linear\n  algebra library is required too. [[https://github.com/xianyi/OpenBLAS][Openblas]] is a good option.\n\n* Usage\n  See the file ~test_sparse_classif.py~\n  \n\n  \n\n  \n\n\n",
