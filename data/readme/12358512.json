Milne*).\n\n\n>    And he respects Owl, because you can't help respecting anybody\n>    who can spell TUESDAY, even if he doesn't spell it right; but\n>    spelling isn't everything. There are days when spelling Tuesday\n>    simply doesn't count.\n>\n>*Rabbit*, speaking of *Christopher Robin*\n\nIt is a packge to manage arXiv papers (and now you can add other pdfs)\nThis prevents multiple copies of the same paper in `Downloads`, and gives them named that are easier to remember than 1234.3532.\nWol can also allows searching, opening of files and opening a paper's arXiv page in a browser at the type of a word or two.\nThe user can move queried files to different directories which serves as a method of tagging.\n\nThe title is automatically quieried from the internet, and if an arXiv number is given (rather than a filename), the paper will be downloaded.\n\nOnly supports pdfs.\n\nUsage\n---\n\n1) Basic, you can guess these:\n\n        $ wol help\n        $ wol info\n\n2) Add an arXiv paper to directory dir, directory is optional, otherwise goes\ninto default directory:\n\n        $ wol add *????.????* dir\n\n3) Delete an arXiv paper:\n\n        $ wol del 1111.1111\n\n3) Configuration show or edit\n\n        $ wol config\n\n4) Add another dotwol file:\n\n        $ wol addwol newdotwol\n\n5) Find papers that match regexp expression:\n\n        $ wol find thing\n        $ wol find        # displays all\n\n6) Move all files that match a find:\n\n        $ wol mv *????.????* new_directory\n\n7) Update, just checks all is well\n\n        $ wol update\n\n8) Show, displays (upto a maximum) number of files that match a criteria:\n\n        $ wol show thing\n\n9) Show arXiv page in browser, (upto a maximum) number of files that match a criteria:\n\n        $ wol browse thing\n\n10) Put, add any pdf, must give 3 arguments:\n\n        $ wol put /path/to/file.pdf \"Title of the file\" dir\n\nArXiv files are usually of the form `1234.5678`, but they can also be of the\nform `name/1234567`.\nThese are also supported, use (for example) `wol add hep-ph/1234567`\nfor these.\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n1. Get the package from github:\n\n        $ git clone https://github.com/hippyPig/wol\n\n2. Simply put /wol in your chosen path.\n3. Run ./install.sh from directory\n\t1. This simply sets the default WOLDIR to ~/Documents/Wol\n\t2. This is put in your .bashrc:\n\n        \t$ export WOLDIR=/path/to/where/to/put/files\n        \t$ export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/wol\n        \t$ source /path/to/wol/wol-autocomplete.sh  # for autocompletion of args\n\n\n3) **GO!**\n\n\nLicense\n-------\nDistributed under The MIT License, Copyright (c) 2014 Samuel C.
