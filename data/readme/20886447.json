Here we test another approach: \nto open an initially single-authored text to collaboration by anyone interested. \n\nTo have the article on GitHub could already be useful by enabling readers to directly correct misprints,\nwithout having to go through the author. The hope is however that more substantial contributions will be made. \n(If this occurs, it may become necessary to modify the authorship of the resulting text.) \n\nFor some indications on how to compile this article, see the comments in the Latex source file cft33.tex. \nThe necessary Latex packages are all standard except maybe underbracket.sty, which had to be included\nin the source files for Arxiv. \n\nThe BIB file contains hundreds of references, many more than are really used. \nThe superfluous references have not been removed, because some of them could be useful later, \nin particular for versions that would include guides to the literature. \n",
