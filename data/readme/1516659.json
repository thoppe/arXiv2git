  "README.md": "# docsim -- Document similarity programs\n\n## Sentence and file based analysis\n\nThis code may be run either ignoring linebreaks in input text files and \ntreating the whole input file as one sentence. or respecting linebreaks \nin the input files as indicating sentences (as for [SOROKINA+07]). The \ndefault is to treat input files as a whole, ignoring sentence \nboundaries.\n\nTo select respecting sentences use the -S option for docsim-analyze, \ndocsim-compare, and overlapd. Note that you will probably get odd \nresults if there is mismatch in respect for sentences or not between \nanalysis and comparison.\n\nTreating files as a whole means that lib/files.cpp needs a buffer that\ncan read in a complete input file. The buffer size is controlled in\nlib/definitions.h:\n\n```\n#define FILE_BUFFER_SIZE 5000000\n```\n\nAs of 2011-02-16 the maximum psv file size for arXiv is ~4.1MB so a \nbuffer size larger than this is required to treat all files whole.\n\n## Compilation\n\nThe C++ code in directory ccp and under was developed with gcc 4.1.2.\nIt compiles with gcc 4.4 but throws some deprecated header warnings. \n(2011-03-03)\n\nTo compile:\n\n```\n> cd cpp\n> make\n```\n\nThis will build the command line docsim tools but will not build\nthe SOAP-based `overlapd` daemon.\n\n## gSOAP library\n\nThe gSOAP library is needed in order to compile to `overlapd` \ndaemon that provides SOAP-based communication with a memory resident \noverlap corpus.\n\n### RedHat (RHEL6)\n\nAs of 2014-07 the standard RHEL6 packages for `gsoap` and `gsoap-devel`\nare version 2.7.16. These may be installed with:\n\n```\nsudo yum install gsoap gsoap-devel\n```\n\nThis installs in the system paths with prefix `/usr` (ie. shared \nlibraries in `/usr/lib`, headers in `/usr/include`, binaries in\n`/usr/bin`). The `Makefile` in `cpp/soap-server` is set up for these\nlocations. From the root directory, make `overlapd` with:\n\n```\nmake soap\n```\n\n### Debian and derivatives\n\n*Warning - notes from 2007 and may be out of date*\n\nOn Debian and derivative systems (e.g. Ubuntu) this should be\navailable for etch and later distributions via apt. Install with, e.g.\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install gsoap\n```\n\nIn March 2007 the current version on etch was 2.7.6 which was fine and\napt installed it under `/usr`. The `Makefile` in `cpp/soap-server` \nis set up for this location.\n\n### Other systems\n\nFor other systems, try sourceforge:\n<http://sourceforge.net/projects/gsoap2/>\n\n\n## Other libraries\n\nGzstream - this library was downloaded from \n<http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/compgeom/gzstream/>\non 2011-08-25 and is included within the cpp/include directory. It is \nused to allow the code to read plain or gzip format data files (to allow \ndisk space saving). The make files for Docsim will compile this code.\nThis is LGPL licensed.\n\n\n## Testing\n\nFor a simple test run with data supplied. First create analyze a set of\ntestdata to build a keys file:\n\n```\ncpp/docsim-analyze -d testdata/arxiv-publicdomain -f testdata/arxiv-publicdomain/files.txt -b 20\n```\n\nAnd then compare one of the documents against the corpus:\n\n```\ncpp/docsim-compare -f testdata/arxiv-publicdomain/0012/math0012129.txt.gz -b 20 -T /tmp/allkeys\n```\n\n\n## Credits\n\nThese programs extend work reported in \"Plagiarism Detection in\narXiv\", Daria Sorokina, Johannes Gehrke, Simeon Warner, Paul Ginsparg\n[ICDM'06, <http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0702012>].
