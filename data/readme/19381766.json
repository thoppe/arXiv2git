  "README.rst": "==========\nDeba bocho\n==========\n\nSlice up PDFs like a pro::\n\n    % bocho my-fancy-file.pdf --pages 1 3 5 6 10 --angle 30 --zoom 1.6\n    my-fancy-file-bocho-630x290.png\n\nTakes a PDF file and creates a \"stacked page\" preview from a selection of pages.\n\nIt accepts a bunch of options for customising the output (pass the ``-h`` flag for details).\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nRequires ImageMagick so you might need to, e.g::\n\n    % sudo apt-get install imagemagick\n\nIf you want to use ``Wand`` instead of calling ``convert`` directly, you'll also need to perform some some additional steps, e.g::\n\n    % sudo apt-get install libmagickwand-dev\n    % pip install wand\n\nSee their installation instructions for more details.\n\nOn OS X, you'll want to use Homebrew to get the low-level dependencies in place::\n\n    % brew install ghostscript imagemagick\n\nOnce all that's sorted, you just need to ``pip install deba-bocho``.\n\nPyPy: Oh My!\n============\n\nFor simple operations, there's not much difference in performance between CPython and PyPy.\nIf you want to use the ``shadow`` effect, it's a different matter.\nCue unscientific benchmarking run on my laptop...\n\nPython 2.7::\n\n    % time bocho /tmp/report.pdf --preset example --shadow\n    ...\n    bocho /tmp/report.pdf --preset example --shadow  35.89s user 0.15s system 99% cpu 36.132 total\n\nPyPy::\n\n    % time bocho /tmp/report.pdf --preset example --shadow\n    ...\n    bocho /tmp/report.pdf --preset example --shadow  4.10s user 0.18s system 99% cpu 4.297 total\n\nMaking PyPy about 10x as fast as Python 2.7.\nThe same process without ``--shadow`` takes around 2.5 seconds with both implementations.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\nFor information on usage, run ``bocho --help``. If you want to use it as a module::\n\n   >>> import bocho\n   >>> help(bocho.assemble)\n\nConfiguration\n=============\n\nIf you will be using the same options many times, it's probably worth creating a preset in a ``config.ini`` file (see config.example.ini_ or the example below to get started).\n\n.. _config.example.ini: https://github.com/jimr/deba-bocho/blob/master/config.example.ini\n\nBy default, ``bocho`` will check for ``$HOME/.config/bocho/config.ini``, so it's probably best to keep your config there, but you can pass the ``--config`` option with the path to an alternative location.\n\n.. code-block:: ini\n\n    [example]\n    pages = 1,3,5,7,9\n    width = 630\n    height = 290\n    border = 4\n    reuse = true\n    delete = true\n    verbose = true\n    use_convert = true\n    parallel = 5\n\nYou can tell ``bocho`` to use this preset by calling::\n\n    bocho /path/to/file.pdf --preset example [--config /path/to/config.ini]\n\nTODO\n====\n\n- implement rotation properly \n- allow a \"zoom\" option \n- optional drop-shadows \n- make shadows smarter in their orientation (they're currently uniform, not respecting the angle / transformations)\n- make the basic edge separators optional \n- automatic spacing as an option as well as fixed pixel spacing\n- horizontal and vertical spacing \n- horizontal and vertical offsets \n- optional right-to-left stacking \n- handle non-A4 aspect ratio input documents \n- optionally apply transforms:\n\n  - affine  (abandoned in favour of vertical / horizontal shear effects)\n  - shear  (applied by creating simplified affine transforms)\n  - stretch (can be achieved in a similar fashion to shear)\n  - perspective\n\n- ensure sliced PNGs are large enough when custom width / height are specified\n- fix x and y spacing calculation to account for any applied rotation & transformation\n- allow transforms to be configurable (probably with presets defined in an ``.ini`` file)\n- drop the PyPDF dependency \n- use an ImageMagick binding rather than using ``subprocess`` to call ``convert``  (Wand)\n- optionally re-use pages between runs \n- allow user-specified resolution for the PDF to PNG conversion \n- docs \n- pretty pictures illustrating the effect of the various options\n- use proper logging\n\nLicense\n=======\n\nSee ``LICENSE.txt``.\nTest images are from the USC-SIPI Image Database (http://sipi.usc.edu/database/).\nThe test PDF is \"Distributed Space-Time Interference Alignment\" (`arXiv:1405.0032 <http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0032>`_).\n",
