Its primary goal is the simultaneous but individual reconstruction of the diffuse and point-like photon flux given a single photon count image, where the fluxes are superimposed.\n\nIn order to discriminate between these morphologically different signal components, a probabilistic algorithm is derived in the language of `information field theory <http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/ift/>`_ based on a hierarchical Bayesian parameter model. The signal inference exploits prior information on the spatial correlation structure of the diffuse component and the brightness distribution of the spatially uncorrelated point-like sources.\nSince the derivation of the solution is not dependent on the underlying position space, the implementation of the D3PO algorithm uses the `NIFTY <http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/ift/nifty/>`_ package to ensure applicability to various spatial grids and at any resolution.\n\n*Parts of this summary are taken from* [1]_ *without marking them explicitly as\nquotations.*\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nRequirements\n............\n\n*   `Python <http://www.python.org/>`_ (v2.7.x)\n\n    *   `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ and `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_\n    *   `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org/>`_\n    *   `multiprocessing <http://docs.python.org/2/library/multiprocessing.html>`_\n        (standard library)\n\n*   `NIFTY <https://github.com/information-field-theory/nifty>`_ (v1.0.6) - Numerical Information\n    Field Theory\n\nDownload\n........\n\nThe latest release is tagged **v1.0.1** and is available as a source package\nat `<https://github.com/information-field-theory/d3po/tags>`_. The current version can be\nobtained by cloning the repository::\n\n    git clone git://github.com/information-field-theory/d3po.git\n\nInstallation\n............\n\n*   D3PO can be installed using `PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi>`_ and\n    **pip** by running the following command::\n\n        pip install ift_d3po\n\n    Alternatively, a private or user specific installation can be done by::\n\n        pip install --user ift_d3po\n\n*   D3PO can be installed using **Distutils** by running the following command::\n\n        cd d3po\n        python setup.py install\n\n    Alternatively, a private or user specific installation can be done by::\n\n        python setup.py install --user\n        python setup.py install --install-lib=/SOMEWHERE\n\nFirst Steps\n...........\n\nTo get started, you can browse through the\n`how-to guide <http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/ift/d3po/HOWTO.html>`_\nor simply run the demonstration::\n\n        >>> run -m d3po.demo\n\nAcknowledgement\n---------------\n\nPlease, acknowledge the use of D3PO in your publication(s) by using a phrase\nsuch as the following:\n\n    *\"Some of the results in this publication have been derived using the D3PO\n    algorithm [Selig et al., 2014].\"*\n\nReferences\n..........\n\n..
