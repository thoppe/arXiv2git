To install, open R and type:\n\n```R\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\nlibrary(\"devtools\")\ninstall_github(\"Storeylab/lfa\")\n```\n\nData input\n===\n\nRecommend using `read.bed` to read in a PLINK binary genotype file, or manually reading a text file of 0, 1, and 2 via `read.table` with the `colClasses` option set to `rep(\"integer\", n)`, where `n` is the number of individuals.\n\nBe warned that both the `lfa` function and the genotype matrices require a lot of memory, since we're just storing the genotype matrices as integer arrays (which take up a lot of space in R!) and doing normal math operations on them. As a rule of thumb, the in memory sizes of a few relevant genotype matrices:\n\n- 431345 SNPs by 940 individuals: 1.5 Gb needed for genotype matrix, about 9 Gb to run `lfa`.\n- 339100 SNPs by 1500 individuals: 1.9 Gb needed for genotype matrix, about 11.5 Gb to run `lfa`.\n\nIf you want to run something but don't have the computing power for it, shoot me an email at whao@princeton.edu. There are number of workarounds that can trade off between memory and time that I've used in the past.\n\n\nFAQ\n===\n\nApple OS X users may experience a problem due to Fortran code that is included in this package.  This gfortran issue is discussed here: \n\nhttp://www.thecoatlessprofessor.com/programming/rcpp-rcpparmadillo-and-os-x-mavericks-lgfortran-and-lquadmath-error. \n\nA solution that has worked for us is to follow the advice given above. Specifically, open a Terminal and type:\n\n```\ncurl -O http://r.research.att.com/libs/gfortran-4.8.2-darwin13.tar.bz2\nsudo tar fvxz gfortran-4.8.2-darwin13.tar.bz2 -C /\n```\n\nIf you know what causes this, let us know!\n\n",
