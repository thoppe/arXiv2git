  "README.md": "#Market Sentiment using Business Week archives\n\n##Purpose\nThe purpose of this program is to create a visualization comparing historical market sentiment alongside the performance of the S&P 500. The hypothesis is that the market sentiment will correlate with market performance.\n\n##Method\nThis python program scrapes the data from the Business Week archives. All the words in the headline and the article text are analyzed. The words are commpared to the sentiment file (reference below) and a score is tabulated for each month.\n\n##Note\nAs can be seen from the plot, the correlation is there but not satisfactory. The methods used to determine sentiment will need to be refined further. \n\n##Next steps\nA more detailed analysis will be conducted using the Natural Language ToolKit for Python.\n\n##Sentiment File used\nFinn Arup Nielsen\n\n\"A new ANEW: Evaluation of a word list for sentiment analysis in microblogs\",\n\nProceedings of the ESWC2011 Workshop on 'Making Sense of Microposts':\n\nBig things come in small packages 718 in CEUR Workshop Proceedings : 93-98. 2011 May.\n\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1103.2903\n\n\n",
