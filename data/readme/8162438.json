  "README.md": "Rezk Completion\n===============\n\nThis Coq library mechanizes the Rezk completion as described in\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1303.0584\n\nIt builds upon V. Voevodsky's Foundations library, available on\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0053\n\n# Installation\n\nThis library is part of the UniMath repository, available at https://github.com/UniMath/UniMath . \nThe recommended way to obtain this library is to install UniMath. Instructions for installing UniMath can be found on the UniMath web page.\nThe below installation instructions should be considered as obsolete.\n\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Coq\n\nThe library compiles under Coq8.3pl5, patched according to the instructions given in \nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0053. \nLower patch levels of Coq8.3, e.g., Coq8.3pl2, are likely to work as well.\n\n### Libraries\n\nFiles used from V. Voevodsky's Foundations:\n\n  - uuu.v\n  - uu0.v\n  - hProp.v\n  - hSet.v\n  - funextfun.v\n\nThey should be installed in the user-contrib/Foundations directory of Coq, so\nCoq can find them. \n\n\nLicensing and copyright\n=======================\n\nAuthors: Benedikt Ahrens, Chris Kapulkin, Mike Shulman\n\nThe code in this repository is made available under the terms of \"CC0\n1.0 Universal\", see\n[http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode).\nThat means, basically, that we disclaim all rights, including copyright, and put\nit into the public domain.\n\nThe code in this repository is (also) put into the public domain, which\nmeans we disclaim any and all copyright protection.\n\n",
