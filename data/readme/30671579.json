  "README.md": "# Author Roulette!!!\n\nA protocol for randomizing author order based on a public seed, along with a LaTeX implementation.\n\n## Motivation\n\nThe widespread \"co-first star\" signals that authors intend to share credit equally.\nBut it can be unclear whether the order of the first two authors is intended to convey extra tie-breaking information.\n\nWe decided to make a protocol for randomization of author order with the following features:\n\n1. Even the authors themselves can't rig the results.\n2. Everyone can verify that it was really random.\n\n## Public record and random seed\n\nThe idea is to base a random permutation of author order on a seed which is\nunknowable until after an initial public submission. An imperfectly secure but\nperfectly adequate seed is the paper's arXiv identifier. An ironclad option is\nthe [NIST randomness beacon](https://beacon.nist.gov/home) for tomorrow at noon.\n\n## Protocol\n\n1. Prepare a version of your paper with an arbitrary author order and a sentence\n   declaring your intended seed.  For example, \"The seed will be this paper's\n   arXiv identifier.\" as a comment in the LaTeX source.\n2. Submit the first version to a public forum (e.g. arXiv).\n3. Obtain the now-available seed and permute the author order iff the XOR of the\n   seed's 5 least significant bits is 0 (this gentle hash doesn't add\n   randomness, just surprise).\n4. The newly equal-but-more-equal author buys her coauthor a drink.\n",
