  "README.md": "Exoplanet population inference\n==============================\n\nThis repository contains the code and text for the paper [Exoplanet population\ninference and the abundance of Earth analogs from noisy, incomplete catalogs](\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3020)\nby Daniel Foreman-Mackey, David W. Hogg, and Timothy D. Morton and submitted\nto ApJ.\n\nThe code lives in the `code` directory and the LaTeX source code for the paper\nis in `document`.\n\n**Code**\n\nThe meat of the probabilistic model is implemented in `population.py`. Then\nthere are a set of scripts that you can use to generate the figures from the\npaper. You should look at the docstrings for details but the summary is:\n\n* `simulate.py` generates synthetic catalogs from known occurrence rate\n  density functions,\n* `main.py` does the MCMC analysis on either real or simulated catalogs, and\n* `results.py` analyzes the results of the MCMC, makes some figures, and thins\n  the chain to the published form.\n\nResults\n-------\n\nOur simulated catalogs and results are [available online on figshare](\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.1051864).\n\nAttribution\n-----------\n\nThis code is associated with and written specifically for [our\npaper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.3020).
