Each followed by the right site of the production. The nonterminals are numbered consecutively, beginning by 0.\n\n\n### Repair ###\n\nA modified version of the repair algorithm (http://www.dcc.uchile.cl/~gnavarro/software/index.html) produces a console output of the form: nonterminal -> right side. These can also be used, note that before loading such a file it need to be transformed. Only two nonterminals are allowed on the right side.",
