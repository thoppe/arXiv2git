  "README.md": "# paims_codes\n\n### Overview\nThis repository contains an extension to the Asymptotically Independent Markov Sampling (AIMS) algorithm for stochastic optimisation purposes and has been currently developed for the estimation of the hyper-parameters of a Gaussian process emulator. This work is part of my PhD research project at the [University of Liverpool](https://www.liv.ac.uk/risk-and-uncertainty/). Currently the only version available is on `Matlab` but it is expected to be written in `R` and `Python` in the near future. \n\n### Contents\n* A *startup* file to load all directories needed for the sampler.  \n* The `matlab-files` directory contains all files needed for the examples to run. Being  \n```Matlab\n    [ ... ] = parallel_aims_opt( ... ) \n```\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the main code for the sampler.  \n* The `examples` directory contains several examples used in the paper submitted with the results obtained from such extension.  \n\n### Citing\nWe would be grateful if any results based on this parallel adaptive extension are acknowledged by citing our paper. It is currently available on [arxiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08010)\n\n```TeX\n@Article{Garbuno2015,\n  Title                    = {{Gaussian process hyper-parameter estimation using parallel asymptotically independent Markov sampling}},\n  Author                   = {Garbuno-Inigo, Alfredo, and DiazDelaO, F.~A., and Zuev, K.~M.},\n  Journal                  = {Arxiv},\n  Year                     = {2015},\n\n  Archiveprefix            = {arXiv},\n  Arxivid                  = {1506.08010},\n  Url                      = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.08010}\n}\n```\n",
