The SVM should output a +1,0,-1 label for every image pair after training.\n If you are using libsvm, you can use the class_hat to know the predicted output for each attribute, and you can write an additional script that will load all of these and\n combined them. You also ideally want to use the kernel that maximizes performance (grid search on C and G parameters from 10^-5 to 10^5). \n Combinining attributes is simply a sum of the labels, where a positive value means that virality was correctly predicted, and a negative label means it was\n incorrectly predicted. Ties were removed by selecting a random positive/negative outcome and running the classifier 100 times, to later compute average performance. Notice\n however that ties need not to be removed for future applications, we had to do such process since our ground truth was a virality score that presented no equal values (one\n image was always more viral than another one in our dataset, and there weren't any ties).\n\n\n### Other reminders \n\n\nYou will need to know the virality_label of each pair to train your SVM with correct labels for every label.\nMoreoever, we create the relative features by always subtracting the nonviral descriptor from the viral descriptor, hence saving each relative feature with the id of the viral image.\n\n\n### Download DECAF6 features:\nhttp://brie.uchicago.edu/ftp-www/Viral_total/viral_decaf6_feats.mat\n\n### ArXiv paper pre-print:\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1503.02318\n\n### Virality Project Website\nhttp://arturodeza.github.io/virality/\n\n### Dataset Download\nhttps://computing.ece.vt.edu/~arturo/viral_datasetV2.mat\n\n### Poster Summary\nPresented at CVPR and at the Scene Understanding Workshop (SUNw), 2015.\n\nhttp://brie.uchicago.edu/ftp-www/Posters/virality_poster_update_final.pdf\n\n### Raw Dataset\nOriginally created by the SNAP group at Stanford for the paper: \"What's in a name?\", 2013.
