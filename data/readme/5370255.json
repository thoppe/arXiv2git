  "README": "This package of codes is released under GPL v3 license.\nIf you find bug, please let me know via: xinguo2@alumni.cityu.edu.hk\nGuo Xin August 10, 2012\n\nThis package of codes generates Table 5 of the draft\n\"Towards a Mathematical Foundation of Immunology and Amino Acid Chains\"\navailable at arXiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.6031v2\n\nThe C dynamic library should be compiled in unix-like system\n(e.g. MacOS, Linux) since POSIX thread tool is used. To compile,\njust type\n\n$ make\n\nand the Makefile script will finish all the things.\n\nFile \"new.Data\" contains the new binding data selected as\ndescribed in the paper for Table 5.\n\nThe file \"internals.R\" stores some necessary functions used.\nThe program \"fixLambda.R\" was used to fix by leave one out cross \nvalidation the regularization parameter lambda. It verifies that\nexp(-13) is just the optimal value. If you believe what I say,\nyou need not to run it.\n\nThe main program is in the R file \"gen.tab5.R\" which will output\nan R data package \"report.Rdata\" from where the predicted\nbinding affinity can be found. These values are used to generate\nthe Table 5 mentioned above. To run it, try\n\n$ Rscipt gen.tab5.R\n\nI also made some codes to cope with Nielsen's software\nhttp://www.cbs.dtu.dk/cgi-bin/nph-sw_request?netMHCIIpan\nFor using the software, I suppose one adjust the data \nhimself/herself. However if you feel it too difficult,\nthe package \"compare with MHCIIpan2.0.zip\" maybe a fine resort. Many files \nare stored there and I just forgot how they were operated. If you have to\nturn to the package, good luck.\n",
