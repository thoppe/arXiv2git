It includes state-of-the-art optimization and inference algorithms beyond message passing. OpenGM handles large models efficiently, since (i) functions that occur repeatedly need to be stored only once and (ii) when functions require different parametric or non-parametric encodings, multiple encodings can be used alongside each other, in the same model, using included and custom C++ code. No restrictions are imposed on the factor graph or the operations of the model. OpenGM is modular and extendible. Elementary data types can be chosen to maximize efficiency. The graphical model data structure, inference algorithms and different encodings of functions interoperate through well-defined interfaces. The binary OpenGM file format is based on the HDF5 standard and incorporates user extensions automatically.\n\nFeatures\n\n    Factor Graph Models (Kschischang et al. 2001)\n        Graphs of any order and structure, from second order grid graphs to irregular higher-order models\n        Arbitrary (commutative and associative) operations, including sum, product, conjunction and disjunction\n        Flexible number of labels (different variables can have differently many labels)\n        Function sharing across factors\n        Function type abstraction.
