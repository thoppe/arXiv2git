  "README.md": "Hamiltonian Annealed Importance Sampling (HAIS)\n================================\n\nHAIS is a method for combining Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) and Annealed Importance Sampling (AIS), \nso that a single Hamiltonian trajectory can stretch over many AIS intermediate distributions. This \ngreatly improves the efficiency of AIS in continuous state spaces.  It is described in detail in the paper:\n> J Sohl-Dickstein, BJ Culpepper<br>\n> Hamiltonian annealed importance sampling for partition function estimation<br>\n> Redwood Technical Report (2011)<br>\n> http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.1925\n\nThe code in this repository can be used for log\nlikelihood estimation, partition function estimation, and importance\nweight estimation.  It can also be used as a Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampler.  See **HAIS_examples.m** for usage examples.\n\n### Files\n- **HAIS_examples.m** demonstrates the capabilities of this code in a variety of scenarios.\n- **HAIS.m** performs Hamiltonian Annealed Importance Sampling.\n- **HAIS_logL.m** calculates the log likelihood of a model given data using HAIS.\n- **HAIS_logL_aux.m** calculates the log likelihood of a model with hidden (auxiliary) variables given data using HAIS.\n",
