  "README.md": "LibBi package: SIR\n==================\n\nSynopsis\n--------\n\n    ./init.sh\n\nThis fits the bridge weight function. GNU Octave and GPML are\nrequired. Running it is optional, as the included files already have this set\nup.\n\n    ./run.sh\n    \nThis samples from the posterior distribution using a Russian influenza data\nset.\n\n    octave --path oct/ --eval \"plot_and_print\"\n\nThis plots the results.\n\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nThis package includes a stochastic SIR (susceptible/infectious/recovered)\nepidemiological compartmental model of the form\n\n$$\\begin{eqnarray}\ndS(t) &=& -\\beta(t)S(t)I(t)\\, dt \\\\\\\\\ndI(t) &=& \\left(\\beta(t)S(t)I(t)-\\nu(t)I(t)\\right)\\, dt \\\\\\\\\ndR(t) &=& \\nu(t)I(t)\\, dt \\\\\\\\\nd\\log\\beta(t) &=& \\left(\\theta_{\\beta,1}-\\theta_{\\beta,2}\\log\\beta(t)\\right)\\, dt+\\theta_{\\beta,3}\\, dW_{\\beta}(t) \\\\\\\\\nd\\log\\nu(t) &=& \\left(\\theta_{\\nu,1}-\\theta_{\\nu,2}\\log\\nu(t)\\right)\\, dt+\\theta_{\\nu,3}\\, dW_{\\nu}(t).\n\\end{eqnarray}$$\n\nIt also includes an observational data set of an epidemic of Russian influenza\nat a boys boarding school (Anonymous 1978). As this is a closed system the\nobservations are considered exact, and the task is to simulate diffusion\nbridges between the observed values, and to estimate parameters.\n\nThe model and data set were used as a test case in Del Moral & Murray\n(2014). The package may be used to reproduce the results in that paper.\n\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nAnonymous.
