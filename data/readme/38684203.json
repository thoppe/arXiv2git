You may save this path for your next Matlab sessions: follow the menu File . Set Path... and save.\n\n\n##Directory structure##\n\n<pre>\n./ The top directory with README.md\n |manoptAuxiliary   - Added solver and manifold (use with manopt)\n   |--- lbfgsSolver/       - Manifold BFGS\n   |--- pdManifold/        - psd and hpd classes \n   |--- wolfeLinesearch/   - Line search algorithm satisfy Wolfe conditions\n | means-medians/   - algos for means and medians of PSD matrices\n | examples/        - some examples showing how to use GOPT\n | eg/              - algorithms specific to EGDs\n | kotz/            - algorithms specific to Kotz type distributions\n | ThirdParty/      - Third party tools\n   |--- randraw/          - m-function written by Alex Bar-Guy\n   |--- manopt/           - the manopt toolbox\n   |--- prettyPlot/       - our version of Mark Schmidt's plot tools\n\n</pre>\n## HOW TO CITE ##\n\nIf you find manifold LBFGS or the PSD (HPD) manifold useful in your work, please cite the following two papers:\n\n<pre>\n\n@Article{gopt,\n  title={Conic Geometric Optimization on the Manifold of Positive Definite Matrices},\n  author={Sra, Suvrit and Hosseini, Reshad},\n  journal={SIAM Journal on Optimization},\n  volume={25},\n  number={1},\n  pages={713--739},\n  year={2015},\n  publisher={SIAM}\n}\n\n@Article{manopt,\n  author  = {Nicolas Boumal and Bamdev Mishra and P.-A.
