  "README.md": "## Hybrid Simplification using Deep Semantics and Machine Translation\n\nSentence simplification maps a sentence to a simpler, more readable\none approximating its content. In practice, simplification is often\nmodeled using four main operations: splitting a complex sentence into\nseveral simpler sentences; dropping and reordering phrases or\nconstituents; substituting words/phrases with simpler ones.\n\nThis is implementation from our ACL'14 paper. We have modified our\ncode to let you choose what simplification operations you want to\napply to your complex sentences. Please go through our paper for more\ndetails. Please contact Shashi Narayan\n(shashi.narayan(at){ed.ac.uk,gmail.com}) for any query.\n\nIf you use our code, please cite the following paper. \n\n**Hybrid Simplification using Deep Semantics and Machine Translation,\n  Shashi Narayan and Claire Gardent, The 52nd Annual meeting of the\n  Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL), Baltimore,\n  June. https://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P14/P14-1041.pdf.**\n\n> We present a hybrid approach to sentence simplification which\n> combines deep semantics and monolingual machine translation to\n> derive simple sentences from complex ones. The approach differs from\n> previous work in two main ways. First, it is semantic based in that\n> it takes as input a deep semantic representation rather than e.g., a\n> sentence or a parse tree. Second, it combines a simplification model\n> for splitting and deletion with a monolingual translation model for\n> phrase substitution and reordering. When compared against current\n> state of the art methods, our model yields significantly simpler\n> output that is both grammatical and meaning preserving.\n\n### Current Status\n\n* Transformation model is retested for both training and testing.\n\n* ToDo: Test the moses model.  \n\n* ToDo: Test if we successfully incorporated improvements from our\n arXiv paper. http://arxiv.org/pdf/1507.08452v1.pdf\n\n      * OOD words at the border should be dropped.\n      * Don't split at \"TO\".\n      * Full stop at the end of the sentence. \n\n* ToDo: Change to online version of sentence simplification.\n\n* ToDo: Upload small set of training and test sets. \n\n### Requirements\n\n* Boxer 1.00:  http://svn.ask.it.usyd.edu.au/trac/candc/wiki/boxer\n* Moses: http://www.statmt.org/moses/?n=Development.GetStarted\n* Mgiza++:  http://www.statmt.org/moses/?n=Moses.ExternalTools#ntoc3\n* NLTK toolkit: http://www.nltk.org/\n* Python 2.7\n* Stanford Toolkit: http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tagger.html",
