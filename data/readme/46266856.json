  "README.md": "# WiBaS\n\nWiBaS (\"Williams' Background Suppression\") is a lightweight and \neasy-to-use C++ implementation of the Q-value method published by Mike Williams:\n\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/0809.2548  \nhttp://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-0221/4/10/P10003\n\nWiBaS is written by Julian Pychy as a member of the PANDA collaboration (https://panda.gsi.de) \nand is distributed under the GPLv3.\nThe package allows a simple definition of the phasespace metric and configuration of the fitting processes using C++ objects. \nSeveral analyses making use of it are in progress and first results have been published:\n\nhttp://epjc.epj.org/articles/epjc/abs/2015/03/10052_2015_Article_3341/10052_2015_Article_3341.html\n\n## Usage\nThe files  in the *src* folder can easily be included in any C++ project. \nThe second folder contains two commented example analyses\nin which the background below an omega meson signal is removed.\n\n### ACLiC\n\nIn this case the package is used within an ACLiC compiled ROOT script (https://root.cern.ch/).\nIn an Unix environment, start by executing ``root -l root_startscript.cc`` in the corresponding folder.\n\n### Standalone\n\nThis folder contains an example how to use the package in a gcc compiled application, which requires linking against \ninstalled ROOT and RooFit libraries. Just type ``make`` to build. \n",
