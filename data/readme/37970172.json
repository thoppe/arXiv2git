  "README.md": "Projection predictive input variable selection using Stan+R\n===========================================================\n\nThis repository contains simple example codes for performing projection predictive variable selection for linear regression models using Stan+R. The method is described in detail in the document. See also our comparative study for performance evaluation of the method (Piironen and Vehtari, 2015).\n\n\nExample\n-------\nYou should have RStan installed. Run first\n\n    library(rstan)\n    source('projection.R')\n\nAfter that you can run one of the main scripts, either\n\n    source('search.R')\n    \nor \n\n    source('search_cv.R')\n\nBoth of these will take some time to execute, but you can reduce the running time by reducing the number of samples generated by Stan (see files `search.R` and `search.R`)\n\nReferences\n------------\nPiironen, J. and Vehtari, A.
