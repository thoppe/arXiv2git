  "README.md": "arXiv-mode\n==========\n\narxiv-mode is an [Emacs](www.gnu.org/s/emacs/) major mode for viewing\nupdates on [arXiv.org](http://arxiv.org).\n\nCurrently this project is its early stage, working functions include\nsearch for the articles posted on a given date, in a given\ncategory. The mode will generate a list of articles where one can\nnavigate and read the abstracts. One can also open the url to the\narticle with a custom defined web browser.\n\n\nCommon Usage\n============\n\nTo start reading abstracts, run `M-x arxiv-read`, and enter the date\nand category you would like to read.\n\nIn the article list, use `n` and `p` to navigate the article list. One\ncan use `C-u` to prefix the navigation commands for more movement\nsteps. Press `a` to toggle visibility of the abstract window. Press\n`u` to open the entry in a web browser. Press `q` to exit the mode.\n\nInstallation\n============\n\nJust put the directory in your filesystem and at it to your\n`load-path`. Put the following into your `.emacs` file\n\n````lisp\n(require 'arxiv-mode)\n````\n\nCustomization\n=============\n\n`arxiv-mode` can be customized through emacs native customization\ninterface. Currently only a few variables can be modified but others\nwill be added as code develops. These can be found under the group\n`arxiv`, or just run `arxiv-customize`.\n\nTODO\n====\n\nCurrently I'm working on better paging support and\nnavigation. Following are the functionality that I have in mind for\nsome point in the future:\n\n* Ability to download pdf to a temporary location and open it in an\n  external viewer.\n\n* Integration with Zotero so that one can put an article into\n  collection directly.\n\n* Implement a search interface to do complex arXiv searches in Emacs\n  directly.",
