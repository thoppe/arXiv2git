Papers are upvoted and discussed by the community, and we sometimes play host to more [in depth peer review](https://scirate.com/tqc-2014-program-committee).\n\nMAINTAINER'S NOTE: I (Jaiden Mispy) have been hosting and maintaining this project out-of-pocket on behalf of the quant-ph community for a couple of years. I am happy to continue to do so for as long as it is useful to people. However, I don't have much time for more meaningful development, which is sad since there is a *lot* more cool and useful stuff that could potentially be built here!\n\nIf you're interested in funding me to work on it further, taking over the project yourself, or building something related using an optimized searchable database full of arXiv metadata that is updated daily, <a href=\"mailto:jaiden@mispy.me\">let me know</a>! And as always, pull requests are very welcome; I'm happy to help people set this up locally as needed.\n\n## Contributing\n\nWe encourage contributions!\n\n* You can submit a bug report [here](https://github.com/scirate/scirate/issues).\n\n* You can contribute to the code by sending a pull request on Github to the [canonical repository](https://github.com/scirate/scirate).\n\n* You can talk about SciRate on our [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/scirate) and about SciRate development on the [development mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups=#!forum/scirate-dev).\n\n## Setting up for development\n\nSciRate runs on [Ubuntu 14.04](http://releases.ubuntu.com/14.04/) in production. Development in other environments is possible, but this guide will assume you are running some variant of Debian.\n\nWe currently use Ruby 2.2.1 and Rails 4.2. To install this version of Ruby and [RVM](https://rvm.io/):\n\n```shell\ngpg --keyserver hkp://keys.gnupg.net --recv-keys 409B6B1796C275462A1703113804BB82D39DC0E3\n\\curl -sSL https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby=2.2.1\nrvm use 2.2.1 --default\n```\n\nYou will also need some native packages:\n\n```shell\nsudo apt-get install git postgresql libpq-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev nodejs libodbc1 libqt4-dev openjdk-6-jre libqt5webkit5-dev\n```\n\nOur backend depends on [Elasticsearch](http://www.elasticsearch.org/overview/elkdownloads/) to sort through all the papers:\n\n```shell\nwget -O /tmp/elasticsearch.deb https://download.elasticsearch.org/elasticsearch/elasticsearch/elasticsearch-1.5.1.deb\nsudo dpkg -i /tmp/elasticsearch.deb\nsudo update-rc.d elasticsearch defaults 95 10\nsudo service elasticsearch start\n```\n\nFinally, clone the repository and install the Ruby gem dependencies:\n\n```shell\ngit clone git@github.com:scirate/scirate\ncd scirate\nbundle install\n```\n\nSciRate is now set up for development! However, you'll also want a database with papers to fiddle with.\n\n## Setting up the database\n\nIf you've just installed postgres, it'll be easiest to use the default 'peer' authentication method.  Create a postgres role for your user account:\n\n```shell\nsudo -u postgres createuser --superuser $USER\n```\n\nCopy the example database configuration file (:\n\n```\ncp config/database.yml.example config/database.yml\n```\n\nIf using peer authentication, you won't need to edit this file.\n\nThen:\n\n```shell\nrake db:setup\nrake es:migrate\nrake arxiv:feed_import\nrails server\n```\nThis will initialize the database and Elasticsearch, download the basic feed layout, and start the server.\n\n## Populating the database\n\n```shell\nrake arxiv:oai_update\n```\n\nWhen run for the first time, this will download and index paper metadata from the last day. Subsequent calls will download all metadata since the last time. The production server runs this task every day to keep the database in sync.\n\n## Testing\n\nThere is a fairly comprehensive series of unit and integration tests in `spec`. Running `rspec` in the top-level directory will attempt all of them.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n- Original website by [Dave Bacon](http://dabacon.org)\n- [Bill Rosgen](http://intractable.ca/bill/)\n- [Aram Harrow](http://www.mit.edu/~aram/)\n- [Draftable](https://draftable.com/)\n",
