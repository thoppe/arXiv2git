  "README.md": "#### Purpose-built research code\nPlease feel free to contact me if you have any suggestions or questions at umbralcalc@gmail.com. The scripts here are all authored by myself and are therefore not especially _flashy_, however they all should perform relatively bug-free. You can find within this repository:\n\n1. _Shortcut_Bayes.cpp_: This takes as input the Markov-Chain Monte-Carlo posterior samples which you can find [here](http://pla.esac.esa.int/pla/) obtained using CosmoMC (a Fortran Metropolis-Hastings algorithm used prolifically in Cosmology, see [here](http://cosmologist.info/cosmomc)) by the _Planck Collaboration_ and outputs approximate Bayesian evidence ratios (normalisation factors for Bayes theorem - [see here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes_factor)) and maximum likelihood estimates using an ad-hoc frequentist method. The approximation is made by obtaining a multivariate kernel density smoothed likelihood function over 3 core observational features of the Cosmic Microwave Background: the scalar power spectrum amplitude, the scalar spectral index and the tensor-to-scalar ratio while also including the degree of Non-Gaussianity added seperately. There is a version of this code with linear boundary bias corrections included, however the result was not found to be significantly affected. The code essentially takes its priors from a class of multi-field slow-roll cosmic inflation models and compares them to predictions of some single-field mononomial potentials. If (by any chance) you want to use this code, please cite: http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.06951  \n",
