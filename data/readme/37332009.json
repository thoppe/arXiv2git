  "README.md": "# SVfitMEM\nVersion of SVfit based on full gg->H, H->tautau matrix element, documented in the paper arXiv:1603.05910 .\n\n# Installation instructions\nThe SVfitPerformanceStudies package has been developed and tested with CMSSW 7_6_x.\nIt depends on the following other packages:\n\tTauAnalysis/SVfitTF\n\nIn order to install the code, execute:\n\tcmsrel CMSSW_7_6_3\n\tcd CMSSW_7_6_3/src\n\tcmsenv\n\tgit clone https://github.com/veelken/SVfitMEM TauAnalysis/SVfitMEM\n\tgit clone https://github.com/veelken/SVfitTF TauAnalysis/SVfitTF\n\nDo *not* try to compile the code yet.\n\nThe SVfitPerformanceStudies package requires the installation of an external library (VAMP) for numeric integration, which is not included in CMSSW by default.\nIn order to install this library, execute:\n\tIn order to install this library, execute:\n\tcd $CMSSW_BASE\n\tmkdir VAMP\n\tcd VAMP\n\twget http://www.hepforge.org/archive/whizard/vamp-2.2.7.tar.gz\n\ttar -xzvf vamp-2.2.7.tar.gz\n\tcd vamp-2.2.7\n\tmkdir $CMSSW_BASE/VAMP/vamp-2.2.7/prefix\n\tmkdir $CMSSW_BASE/VAMP/vamp-2.2.7/prefix/share/\n\tmkdir $CMSSW_BASE/VAMP/vamp-2.2.7/prefix/share/doc\n\tmkdir $CMSSW_BASE/VAMP/vamp-2.2.7/prefix/share/doc/vamp\n\t./configure --prefix=$CMSSW_BASE/VAMP/vamp-2.2.7/prefix\n\tmake\n\tmake install\n\tcp $CMSSW_BASE/VAMP/vamp-2.2.7/prefix/lib/* $CMSSW_BASE/lib/$SCRAM_ARCH\n\nYou now need to declare the VAMP library as external library in CMSSW.\nIn order to do this, execute:\n\tcp /afs/cern.ch/user/v/veelken/public/vamp.xml $CMSSW_BASE/config/toolbox/slc6_amd64_gcc491/tools/selected/\nand edit the vamp.xml file. \nReplace the lines containing \"/afs/cern.ch/user/v/veelken/\" by the directory where you installed the VAMP library (execute 'echo $CMSSW_BASE/VAMP' to see the full path).\nThen execute:\t\n\tscram setup vamp\n\nNow compile the CMSSW part of the code:\n\tcd $CMSSW_BASE/src\n\tscram b -j 4\n\nIn case of compilation problems, check that the VAMP library has been installed correctly.\nIn order to do this, execute:\n\tscram tool info vamp\nThe output that you should get is:\n\tName : vamp\n\tVersion : 2.2.6\n\t++++++++++++++++++++\n\tSCRAM_PROJECT=no\n\tLIB=vamp\n\tLIBDIR=...../vamp/vamp-2.2.6/src/.libs\n\tINCLUDE=...../vamp/vamp-2.2.6/src\n\tUSE=f77compiler\nIn case you do not get this output, it means that CMSSW does not know that you have installed the VAMP library.\nHave a look on the twiki https://twiki.cern.ch/twiki/bin/view/CMSPublic/SWGuideScram to see hot to fix it.\n\nIn case the VAMP library has been correctly installed and the code still does not compile, please contact christian.veelken AT cern.ch .\n\n",
