It has developped while working in the [ANR MaRDi project](http://mardi.metz.supelec.fr)\n\nInstall/Usage\n-------------\n\n- mkdir build\n- cd build\n- cmake ..\n- make \n\nAs the viewer requires Qt, it has been disabled by default. To allow its compilation, you have to activate it while running cmake : [Yarbus](http://jeremyfix.github.io/dstc \"Yarbus page\")\n\n- cmake .. -DDSTC_Viewer=ON\n- make\n\nThe project is not aimed to be installed anywhere, so set up your LD_LIBRARY_FLAGS correctly before running the scripts :\n- export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:./src\n\n\nMore about the Statistics\n-------------------------\n\nTo compute the statistics\n\n- cd CLONE_DIR/build\n- export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:./src\n- ./src/statistics  dstc2_test.flist\n\nstatistics allows you to compute statistics over the dialogs. It displays the statistics in the console and generate a LaTex file for it as well that you need to compile (calling pdflatex 2 times on it); Below are the computed statistics for DSTC-2 :\n\n- [DSTC-2 training data](./dstc2_train.flist.pdf \"DSTC-2 training\")\n- [DSTC-2 dev data](./dstc2_dev.flist.pdf \"DSTC-2 dev\")\n- [DSTC-2 test data](./dstc2_test.flist.pdf \"DSTC-2 test\")\n\n\nMore about the GUI\n------------------\n\n\nTo run the GUI : \n- cd CLONE_DIR/build\n- export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:./src\n- ./src/viewer \n\nYou can view :\n\n- ontology files\n- dialog and label files (providing a flist file listing the dialogs)\n- tracker output files\n\nAll these files must fit the DSTC JSON format.\n\n![Viewer](./Pics/screenshot.png \"The viewers of DSTC files\")\n\n\n",
