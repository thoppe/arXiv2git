For more information about the method, see the paper at\n\n    http://arxiv.org/abs/0907.1013\n\nThe two scripts are\n\n  compute_ngrams.py:\n\n  Compute recursive multi-word expressions from a corpus.  This will\n  write out a file of vocabulary (including multi-word expressions)\n  and their counts.\n\n  lda_topics.py:\n\n  Compute multi-word expressions per-topic from a corpus and LDA-C\n  fit.  (Note: the argument --ntopics is the same as K in LDA-C.)\n  This will write out a file for each topic with the expressions and\n  counts.  Again, see the paper for details.\n\nAny questions/comments about this code should be posted to the topic\nmodels mailing list.
