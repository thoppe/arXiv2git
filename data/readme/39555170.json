In fact, wristband and armband devices such as smartwatches and fitness trackers already took an important place in the consumer electronics market and are becoming ubiquitous. By their very nature of being wearable, these devices, however, provide a new pervasive attack surface threatening users privacy, among others.\n\nIn the meantime, advances in machine learning are providing unprecedented possibilities to process complex data efficiently. Allowing patterns to emerge from high dimensional unavoidably noisy data.\n\nThe goal of this work is to raise awareness about the potential risks related to motion sensors built-in wearable devices and to demonstrate abuse opportunities leveraged by advanced neural network architectures.\n\nThe LSTM-based implementation presented in this research can perform touchlogging and keylogging on 12-keys keypads with above-average accuracy even when confronted with raw unprocessed data. Thus demonstrating that deep neural networks are capable of making keystroke inference attacks based on motion sensors easier to achieve by removing the need for non-trivial pre-processing pipelines and carefully engineered feature extraction strategies. Our results suggest that the complete technological ecosystem of a user can be compromised when a wearable wristband device is worn.\n\n### Keywords\nSecurity, Side-Channel Attack, Keystroke Inference, Motion Sensors, Deep Learning, Recurrent Neural Network, Wearable Computing\n\n## International media coverage\n* [Wired UK](http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-12/21/smartwatch-typing-spying)\n* [GEEK](http://www.geek.com/news/your-smartwatch-can-guess-your-pin-1642965/)\n* [El Pais](http://tecnologia.elpais.com/tecnologia/2015/12/21/actualidad/1450722128_471371.html)\n* [Vice](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/heres-how-your-smartphone-can-reveal-what-youre-typing)\n* [Gizmodo](http://gizmodo.com/your-smartwatchs-motion-sensors-can-reveal-everything-y-1750442236)\n* [Lifehacker Australia](http://www.lifehacker.com.au/2016/01/should-you-be-worried-about-smartwatches-and-smartphones-spying-on-you/)\n* [Huffington Post](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/smartwatch-hack-passwords_5689e6d5e4b014efe0daceeb?utm_hp_ref=world)\n* [IFL Science](http://www.iflscience.com/technology/new-ways-your-smartwatch-and-phone-may-be-spying-you-how-worried-should-you-be)\n* [XDA Developers](http://www.xda-developers.com/xda-external-link/how-your-smartwatch-can-reveal-what-youre-typing/)\n* [Naked Security](https://nakedsecurity.sophos.com/2016/01/11/could-your-smartwatch-be-giving-away-your-atm-pin/)\n* [Softpedia](http://news.softpedia.com/news/smartwatches-can-be-used-to-spy-on-your-card-s-pin-code-498756.shtml)\n* [Version2](http://www.version2.dk/artikel/itu-studerende-sensorer-i-smartwatch-kan-afsloere-pinkoden-til-dit-dankort-549635)\n* [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/kalevleetaru/2016/01/15/when-cameras-and-wearables-could-be-used-to-steal-passwords-and-keys/)\n* [phys.org](http://phys.org/news/2016-01-ways-smartwatch-spying.html)\n\nOn Danish national TV channel [TV2 NewScience](http://play.tv2.dk/programmer/magasiner/serier/newscience/smarture-kan-afsloere-din-pinkode-109753/)  \nUniversity blog post [here](http://en.itu.dk/About-ITU/Press/News-from-ITU/Your-smartwatch-can-reveal-your-PIN-code)  \nRead comments on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10758298)\n\n## Citation\n\n    @article{beltramelli2015deep,\n      title={Deep-Spying: Spying using Smartwatch and Deep Learning},\n      author={Beltramelli, Tony and Risi, Sebastian},\n      journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.05616},\n      year={2015}\n    }\n\n## Fun fact\nThe original project name was \"SWAT: Spying using Wearable Wristband/Armband Technology\", which explains why some packages still reflect this old name.\n",
