No prior sentence splitting or any sort of preprocessing is expected. The program runs on Linux systems.\n* The overall software work flow is similar to the one described in our paper (ACL 2014). However, to guarantee further efficiency, we remove the post-editing component from the workflow, and remove the set of entity-based transaction features from our feature set. Moreover, both structure and relation classification models are now implemented using CRFSuite.\n\nUSAGE\n-----\n```\ndocker pull vrann/discourse-parser-docker\ndocker run -v /Path/to/text/files:/samples -i -t $container-id\ncd gCRF_dist/src\npython parse.py /samples/F0001.txt\n```\n\n",
