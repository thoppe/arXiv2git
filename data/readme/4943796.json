  "README.md": "mathic\n======\n\nMathic is a C++ library of fast data structures designed for use in\nGroebner basis computation. This includes data structures for ordering\nS-pairs, performing divisor queries and ordering polynomial terms\nduring polynomial reduction.\n\nWith Mathic you get to use highly optimized code with little effort so\nthat you can focus more of your time on whatever part of your Groebner\nbasis implementation that you are interested in. The data structures\nuse templates to allow you to use them with whatever representation of\nmonomials/terms and coefficients that your code uses. In fact the only\nplaces where Mathic defines its own monomials/terms is in the test\ncode and example code. Currently only dense representations of\nterms/monomials are suitable since Mathic will frequently ask \"what is\nthe exponent of variable number x in this term/monomial?\".\n\nThe paper \"Practical Grobner Basis Computation\" describes the data\nstructures from a high level. It was presented at ISSAC 2012 and is\navailable at http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.6940\n",
