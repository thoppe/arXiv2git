  "README.md": "### This repo is deprecated. Please check out the new repositry https://github.com/s9xie/hed for an updated version of HED. (Including training/testing code and a better pretrained model!)\n\n#Holistically-Nested Edge Detection\n\n\nWe provide the pretrained model and testing code for the edge detection framework Holistically-Nested Edge Detection (HED). Please see the Arxiv paper for technical details. The pretrained model achieved an ODS=.782 and OIS=.804 on BSDS benchmark dataset. \n\nWe provide a ipython notebook at **examples/hed_release/HED-tutorial.ipynb** to do the testing and visualization, batch testing is available. NVIDIA K40 or equivlent GPU is recommended. Alternatively, you can use CPU to do the testing by change **net_full_conv.set_mode_gpu()** to **net_full_conv.set_mode_cpu()**.\n\nThe fusion-output, averaged output and individual outputs from 5 scales will be produced. Note that if you want to evaluate the results on BSDS benchmarking dataset, you should do the standard non-maximum suppression, which is not included in this repo. \nWe used Piotr's Structured Forest matlab toolbox available here **https://github.com/pdollar/edges**.\n\nIf you encounter any issue when using our code or model, please let me know.\n\nThis code is based on Caffe. Thanks to the contributors of Caffe. Thanks @shelhamer and @longjon for providing fundamental implementations that enable fully convolutional training/testing in Caffe.\n\n    @misc{Jia13caffe,\n      Author = {Yangqing Jia},\n      Title = { {Caffe}: An Open Source Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding},\n      Year  = {2013},\n      Howpublished = {\\url{http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/}}\n    }\n",
