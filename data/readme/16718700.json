Elastic-net\r\n    2. GraphNet\r\n    3. Fused Lasso\r\n- Run the script `init.m` in the very beginning.\r\n- `sim_run_admm.m` will run the ADMM algorithm for performing binary classification on the synthetic functional connectome.\r\n- `real_run_admm.m` will run the ADMM algorithm for performing binary classification on the real functional connectome.\r\n\r\n\r\n#### Data description\r\nData collection was performed at the Mind Research Network, and funded by a Center of Biomedical Research Excellence (COBRE) grant 5P20RR021938/P20GM103472 from the NIH to Dr. Vince Calhoun.  The COBRE data set can also be downloaded from the COllaborative Informatics and Neuroimaging Suite data exchange tool (COINS[1]; http://coins.mrn.org/dx).  \r\n\r\n[1] A. Scott, W. Courtney, D.
