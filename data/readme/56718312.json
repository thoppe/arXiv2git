Image classification: Each image has one class and classifier can return multiple classes --- if any match the single image class then it's a match (due to multiple objects in one photo). \n\nhttp://yann.lecun.com/exdb/publis/pdf/hadsell-chopra-lecun-06.pdf --> re: convolutional neural networks + dimensionality reduction\n\n\n\n\n\n",
