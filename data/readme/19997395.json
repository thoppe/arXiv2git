This potential installed into the NEMO environment and may be called\nas other NEMO potentials.\n\npotname=caustics\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\ncaustics.h is a header file containing the declaration and \nimplementation of the caustic functions.\nInclusion of the caustic header file allows inline calls to\nthe caustic functions.\n\nUSAGE: apply_caustic_pot_double([position], [acceleration], [potential])\n\n[postion] is a pointer to an array of x, y, z particle positions.\n[acceleration] is a pointer to an array of ax, ay, az particle accelerations.\n[potential] is a pointer to a variable defining the potential as a function of r\n\nIn the standard NEMO defintions these are *pos, *acc and *pot.\n\t\nIf the implementation is using floats this can be called as:\napply_caustic_pot_float([postion], [accerleration], [potential])\n\nIn standard usage the functions would be called as:\n\tapply_caustic_pot_double(*pos, *acc, *pot)\n\tapply_caustic_pot_float(*pos, *acc, *pot)\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nmpc.c \n\nIs a combined potential using a Miyamoto, Plummer and caustics potential using\nthe caustics.h file to include the caustic potential. It is included as an \nexample of usage and to test the installation.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\ninstall_caustics\n\nThis is a shell script that installs the provided potentials. This should work\nfor standard NEMO configurations. More custom environments would need the \npotentials compiled manually.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nTestfile\n\nThis tests the values of the potentials for caustics.c and mpc.c to verify\nthe potentials are functioning in the environment.\n\n________________________________________________________________________________\n\nThere is additional information on the caustic potential in the caustics \ndocumentation and in one of Pierre Sikivie's paper such \nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/astro-ph/9902210\n\nList of authors: Julie Dumas, Adam Susser, Jeff Thompson\n\nAcknowledgements:\n        Pierre Sikivie: For creating the caustic ring theory and for\n                        deriving gfield_far()'s approximation\n        Heywood Tam:    For deriving and coding the initial version of\n                        gfield_close()\n\n\nGit repository: https://github.com/sussea/NEMO_caustics\n",
