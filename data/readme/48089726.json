  "README.md": "# TauStar Package\n\n## Purpose\n\nThis package allows you to efficiently compute, and perform tests of\nindependence with, the U/V-statistic corresponding to the tau* coefficient\ndescribed in the paper:\n\nBergsma, Wicher; Dassios, Angelos. A consistent test of independence based on a\nsign covariance related to Kendall's tau. Bernoulli 20 (2014), no. 2, 1006-1028.\n\nThe tau* statistic has the special property that it is 0 if and only if the\nbivariate distribution it is computed upon is independent (under some weak\nconditions on the bivariate distribution) and is positive otherwise. Since t*, \nthe U-statistic corresponding to tau*, is an unbiased estimator of tau* this \ngives a consistent test of independence. Computing t* naively results an \nalgorithm that takes O(n^4) time where n is the sample size. Luckily it is \npossible to compute t* much faster (in O(n^2*log(n)) time) using the algorithm \ndescribed in:\n\nWeihs, Luca, Mathias Drton, and Dennis Leung. \"Efficient Computation of the\nBergsma-Dassios Sign Covariance.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.00964 (2015).\n\nThis fast algorithm is implemented in this package. Moreover, the package also\nuses the results of Nandy, Weihs, and Drton (2016) to allow the use of t* in\nperforming tests of independence. In particular, we provide the function\ntauStarTest which automates tests of independence using the asymptotic null\ndistribution of t*.\n\n## Example\n\nA simple example of computing t* on a independent bivariate normal distribution\nfollows:\n\n```\n> set.seed(2342)\n> x = rnorm(1000)\n> y = rnorm(1000)\n> tStar(x, y)\n[1] 0.0003637266\n```\n\nSimilarly, we may obtain the asymptotic p-value corresponding to a test of\nindependence as follows:\n\n```\n> set.seed(2341)\n> x = rnorm(1000)\n> y = rnorm(1000)\n> tauStarTest(x, y)$pVal\n[1] 0.5692797\n```\n\nThe main functionality of this package is currently included in the functions\n`tStar` (which computes the t* statistic on two input vectors) and `tauStarTest`\n(which performs tests of independence using t*). One may also be interested in\nthe functions\n\n1. `pHoeffInd`, `dHoeffInd`, `rHoeffInd`, `qHoeffInd`\n2. `pDisHoeffInd`, `dDisHoeffInd`, `rDisHoeffInd`, `qDisHoeffInd`\n3. `pMixHoeffInd`, `dMixHoeffInd`, `rMixHoeffInd`, `qMixHoeffInd`\n\nwhich compute distribution functions, densities, random samples, and quantiles\nfor the asymptotic distribution of t* in different cases.",
