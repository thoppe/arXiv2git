Tested on Linux 64-bit with clang++ 3.0\nand g++ 4.7.0.\n\nreference\n---------\nWorking paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.1790\n\nusage and options\n-----------------\nCompile with make (requires a modern ANSI C++11 compiler) and execute with\n\n    $ ./wagner\n\nYou can change the model with:\n\n    -model\n\nThe current version supports four models:\n\n    0   Neutral model\n    1   Model with aleph (see arXiv paper) [default]\n    2   Model with logistic speciation (decreases with the total number of species).\n    3   Model with both aleph and logistic speciation.    \n\nYou can also use the following options [default values]:\n\n    -seed       Seed for the random number generator [6].\n    -c          Number of communities (or vertices, or nodes, or patches) [64].\n    -t          Number of time steps. Needs to be a power of two [512].\n    -e          Per population extinction rate [0.05].\n    -m          Max migration rate [0.04].\n    -a          Aleph for models 1 and 3 [10.0].\n    -s          Speciation rate (or max speciation rate for logistic models) [0.04].\n    -se         With logistic speciation and n species, the speciation rate is 2s/(1 + se^n) [1.02].\n    -r          Radius of the random geometric network [0.2].\n\nOptions not followed by an argument\n\n    -shuffle    After t/2 time steps, shuffle all populations [false].\n\nFor example: \n\n    $ ./wagner -model 1 -a 50 -seed 88\n\nWill run the model 1 with aleph = 50, and seed = 88. The order of the options\ndoesn't matter and all parameters should be printed in the xml output file. If\nthe number of time steps supplied is not a power of two, the problem will find\nthe largest power of two that fits in this number.\n\nlanguage\n--------\nANSI C++11.\n\nI use many features from the C++11 standard so it requires a modern compiler.\n\nlicense\n-------\nMIT <http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT>\n\nauthor\n------\nPhilippe Desjardins-Proulx <philippe.d.proulx@gmail.com>\n\n",
