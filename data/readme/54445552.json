Copy the folder 'robust' into '[MatConvnet_root]/examples';\n2. Enter the folder '[MatConvnet_root]/examples/robust' and run 'robust_setup.m';\n3. Run 'demo.m' for both training and evaluating.\n\nMoreover, there are pre-trained models in the folder 'pre-trained'. You can evaluate them without training by\n(1).
