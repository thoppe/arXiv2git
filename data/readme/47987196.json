Since it preserves LAPACK's established interfaces, ReLAPACK\nintegrates effortlessly into existing application codes.  ReLAPACK's routines\nnot only outperform the reference LAPACK but also improve upon the performance\nof tuned implementations, such as OpenBLAS and MKL.\n\n\nCoverage\n--------\nFor a detailed list of covered operations and an overview of operations to which\nrecursion is not efficiently applicable, see [coverage.md](coverage.md).\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\nTo compile with the default configuration, simply run `make` to create the\nlibrary `librelapack.a`.\n\n### Linking with MKL\nNote that to link with MKL, you currently need to set the flag\n`COMPLEX_FUNCTIONS_AS_ROUTINES` to `1` to avoid problems in `ctrsyl` and\n`ztrsyl`.  For further configuration options see [config.md](config.md).\n\n\n### Dependencies\nReLAPACK builds on top of [BLAS](http://www.netlib.org/blas/) and unblocked\nkernels from [LAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/).  There are many optimized\nand machine specific implementations of these libraries, which are commonly\nprovided by hardware vendors or available as open source (e.g.,\n[OpenBLAS](http://www.openblas.net/)).\n\n\nTesting\n-------\nReLAPACK's test suite compares its routines numerically with LAPACK's\ncounterparts.  To set up the tests (located int `test/`) you need to specify\nlink flags for BLAS and LAPACK (version 3.5.0 or newer) in `make.inc`; then\n`make test` runs the tests.  For details on the performed tests, see\n[test/README.md](test/README.md).\n\n\nExamples\n--------\nSince ReLAPACK replaces parts of LAPACK, any LAPACK example involving the\ncovered routines applies directly to ReLAPACK.  A few separate examples are\ngiven in `examples/`. For details, see [examples/README.md](examples/README.md).\n\n\nCiting\n------\nWhen referencing ReLAPACK, please cite the preprint of the paper\n[Recursive Algorithms for Dense Linear Algebra: The ReLAPACK Collection](http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06763):\n\n    @article{relapack,\n      author    = {Elmar Peise and Paolo Bientinesi},\n      title     = {Recursive Algorithms for Dense Linear Algebra: The ReLAPACK Collection},\n      journal   = {CoRR},\n      volume    = {abs/1602.06763},\n      year      = {2016},\n      url       = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.06763},\n    }\n",
