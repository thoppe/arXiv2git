See the `documentation <http://openmodes.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_ \nfor full installation instructions and requirements.\n\nThe source is available on `GitHub <https://github.com/DavidPowell/OpenModes>`_,\nand binary packages are available from the `Python Package Index <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/OpenModes>`_.\n\nThis program was written by David Powell, a research fellow with the Nonlinear\nPhysics Centre at the Australian National University. Contact details are available\non my `web page <http://wwwrsphysse.anu.edu.au/nonlinear/people/DavidPowell.shtml>`_.\n\n",
