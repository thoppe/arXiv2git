  "README.md": "#The Harmony Project\nHarmony is the next generation tool to reverse-engineer the information contained in the software version control systems. It is an extensible framework allowing you to gather the information you need to perform advanced studies against the history of software projects.\n\n#User Manual\nIf you want to try Harmony in 2 minutes, analyze your repositories or develop easily your own analysis the User Manual is what you need.\n\nIn addition to the User Manual, several screencasts are available to guide you :\n\n- Harmony installation: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFGXayQADeA\n- Creation of a simple analysis: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iQCeLmu2WDg\n\n#Using Harmony in a research project\nIf you use Harmony within a research project, please cite the following technical report:\n\n>@article{Falleri2013:Harmony,\n  author    = {Jean-R{\\'e}my Falleri and\n               C{\\'e}dric Teyton and\n               Matthieu Foucault and\n               Marc Palyart and\n               Flor{\\'e}al Morandat and\n               Xavier Blanc},\n  title     = {The Harmony Platform},\n  journal   = {CoRR},\n  volume    = {abs/1309.0456},\n  year      = {2013},\n  ee        = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0456},\n  bibsource = {DBLP, http://dblp.uni-trier.de}\n}\n\n#Who are we?\nThe Harmony project is mainly developed by the people of the [Software Engineering research group](http://se.labri.fr/).
