The implementations are not particularly clear, efficient, well tested \nor numerically stable. We advise against using this software for nondidactic \npurposes.\n\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License. \n\nFeatures\n--------\nModels:\n    Feedforward neural network (classifier)\n        Arbitrary number of layers\n        Cross-entropy and negative log-likelihood cost functions\n        Backpropagation\n        Stochastic gradient descent\n        L2 regularization\n        Momentum\n\n        Compatible with python sklearn interface\n    \n    Recurrent neural network (sequence element classifier)\n        Single hidden layer\n        Cross-entropy and negative log-likelihood cost functions\n        Backpropagation\n        Online gradient descent\n        L2 regularization\n        Momentum\n    \n    Long Short-Term memory network (sequence element classifier)\n        Single hidden layer\n        Cross-entropy and negative log-likelihood cost functions\n        Backpropagation\n        Online gradient descent\n        Momentum\n\n    Restricted Boltzmann machine (probabilistic graphical model)\n        Gibbs sampling\n        k-step persistent contrastive divergence\n        Stochastic gradient descent\n        Momentum\n        \n    \nExamples\n--------\nSee the examples directory. \n\nSome examples use keras, a neural networks library.\n\nReferences\n----------\n[1] Nielsen, Michael.
