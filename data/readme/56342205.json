This posterior is with respect to a (non-informative) prior induced by the right Haar measure over a product group of lower triangular matrices acting on the space of Kronecker structured covariance matrices. For any invariant loss function, any Bayes rule with respect to this prior will be the uniformly minimum risk equivariant estimator (UMREE) with respect to that loss. \n* Calculate the UMREE under a multiway generalization of Stein's loss. This estimator dominates the maximum likelihood estimator uniformly over the entire parameter space of Kronecker structured covariance matrices.\n* Calculate a (randomized) orthogonally invariant estimator of the Kronecker structured covariance matrix. This estimator dominates the UMREE under the product group of lower triangular matrices.\n\nThis package is also published on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tensr/index.html).\n\nVignettes are available on\n[Equivariant Inference](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tensr/vignettes/equivariant_estimation.html) and\n[Likelihood Inference](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tensr/vignettes/maximum_likelihood.html).\n\n# Installation\nTo install from CRAN, run in `R`:\n```{r, eval = FALSE}\ninstall.packages(\"tensr\")\n```\n\nTo install the latest version from Github, run in `R`:\n```{r, eval = FALSE}\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\ndevtools::install_github(\"dcgerard/tensr\")\n```\n\n# References\n**Gerard, D.**, & Hoff, P.
