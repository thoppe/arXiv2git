Has a Bitcask and some CRDT implementations in Clojure that might be of interest. I hope to revisit this in 2016**\n\n\n### Eyvind is (not yet) an experimental distributed rule engine written in Clojure.\n\nFoundations inspired by Riak Core. Higher level inspired by Dedalus, Linear Meld, CRDTs and Angelic CHR. Aims to provide Constraint Handling Rules as language, built on a lower-level distributed Datalog and linear logic. Minimal set of dependencies (JeroMQ and tools.logging) to facilitate use as library. Standalone mode with REST (and ZeroMQ) API to be provided as add-on.\n\n\n## References\n\n### Dynamo / Riak\n\n* http://basho.com/assets/bitcask-intro.pdf\n* http://www.slideshare.net/eredmond/distributed-stat-structures\n* http://www.allthingsdistributed.com/files/amazon-dynamo-sosp2007.pdf\n\n### Constraint Handling Rules\n\n* http://www.informatik.uni-ulm.de/pm/fileadmin/pm/home/fruehwirth/Papers/chr-lnai08.pdf\n* https://lifeware.inria.fr/~tmartine/papers/martinez11chr.pdf\n\n### Distributed Datalog and Linear Logic\n\n* http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/papers/datalog2011-dedalus.pdf\n* http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2012/EECS-2012-167.pdf\n* https://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/liminjia/research/papers/incremental-ppdp.pdf\n* http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.3556v1.pdf\n\n### Convergent and Commutative Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)\n\n* http://hal.upmc.fr/inria-00555588/document\n* http://www.infoq.com/articles/Highly-Distributed-Computations-Without-Synchronization\n* http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.2803.pdf\n* http://christophermeiklejohn.com/publications/ppdp-2015-preprint.pdf\n* http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/240462/ecoop15-extended-tr.pdf\n\n\n## License\n\nCopyright (c) 2015 Hakan Raberg\n\nDistributed under the Eclipse Public License either version 1.0 or (at\nyour option) any later version.\n",
