  "README.md": "## Forward-Backward Newton method\n\nThis repository contains implementations of the forward-backward\nNewton (FBN) method for solving separable convex optimization problems\nof the form\n\n```\nminimize f(x) + g(x)\n```\n\nFBN is based on the concept of Forward-Backward Envelope (FBE), a continuously differentiable\nfunction whose minimizers coincide with the solutions of the problem to solve.\nFor further information on the FBE and FBN please refer to [1,2].\n\nThe method is implemented for some examples of problems, and test scripts\nare provided in order to compare it against other algorithms.\n\nProblems implemented so far:\n* Box constrained QP\n* L1 regularized least squares\n* L1 regularized logistic regression\n* Matrix completion\n\n### Future plans\n\nFuture plans include implementing the method with the Julia language.\n\n### References\n\n[1] P.
