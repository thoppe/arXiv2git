  "README.md": "The SABC package is an R implementation of the Approximate Bayes Computations algorithm presented in [1].\n\nTo install, you need to take the following steps:\n\n1) Install devtools by following the instructions at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/devtools/README.html\nThis step is platform-dependent. If you are using Windows, make sure to pick the right version of Rtools depending\non which distribution of R you are using (which can be found via session_info() ). \n\n2) Start a new R session, load the package devtools with \n> library(devtools)\n\nand then install SABC with\n> install_github(\"carloalbert/sabc\",subdir=\"SABC\")\n\n3) Load SABC and read the help file\n> library(SABC)\n\n> ?SABC\n\n\n\n--- \n[1]  C.
