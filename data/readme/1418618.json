A typical use case is to have\nthe \"true\" communities in one file and and those found by your algorithm\nin the other file. One line per community. The nodes are\nseparated by whitespace, and any non-whitespace characters may be used in the\nnode names.\n\n\n== Contact ==\n\nSend any comments or queries or requests to aaronmcdaid@gmail.com\n\n\n== Citation for Bibtex ==\n\n@article{McDaidNMI,\n    abstract = {Given the increasing popularity of algorithms for overlapping clustering, in\nparticular in social network analysis, quantitative measures are needed to\nmeasure the accuracy of a method. Given a set of true clusters, and the set of\nclusters found by an algorithm, these sets of clusters must be compared to see\nhow similar or different the sets are. A normalized measure is desirable in\nmany contexts, for example assigning a value of 0 where the two sets are\ntotally dissimilar, and 1 where they are identical. A measure based on\nnormalized mutual information, [1], has recently become popular. We demonstrate\nunintuitive behaviour of this measure, and show how this can be corrected by\nusing a more conventional normalization. We compare the results to that of\nother measures, such as the Omega index [2].},\n    archivePrefix = {arXiv},\n    author = {McDaid, Aaron F. and Greene, Derek and Hurley, Neil},\n    citeulike-article-id = {9896732},\n    citeulike-linkout-0 = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.2515},\n    citeulike-linkout-1 = {http://arxiv.org/pdf/1110.2515},\n    day = {11},\n    eprint = {1110.2515},\n    month = oct,\n    posted-at = {2011-10-13 02:42:56},\n    priority = {0},\n    title = {Normalized Mutual Information to evaluate overlapping community finding algorithms},\n    url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.2515},\n    year = {2011}\n}\n",
