If you find it useful\nfor a publication, please consider citing that paper.\n\nThe following files and folders are included. Most directories contain\nanother README with information on their contents. Feel free to\ncontact me (neilcrighton@gmail.com) if you want to get any code to run\non your machine. It may take some work!\n\ndiff/\n\n   - This contains a latexdiff showing changes between the initial\n   version submitted to the arXiv and the final accepted version.\n\npython_modules/\n\n   - Contains the modules and packages needed by various python\n   scripts. Add this directory to your PYTHONPATH to use these.\n\ncloudy/\n\n   - Grids of cloudy models and scripts to run mcmc sampling and make\n   plots.\n\ndata/\n\n   - Galaxy spectra, QSO spectrum and imaging of the field.\n\nmagphys/\n\n   - Data used for SED fitting with MAGPHYS.\n\nscripts/\n\n   - Files use to do calculations in the paper and make plots.\n\nvpfit/\n\n   - Voigt profile models found using VPFIT.\n",
