It also gets stuck in local minima.  The solution to this is straight forward\n-- if there has been no change in the fit for some number of steps, increase the dx until there is change -- I just\nhaven't gotten around to coding this.\n\nThere's a neat little feature that lets you watch the fit happen in real time.\nDefinition of exhilirating.\n\nThe rest of the code (i.e. most of it) is by Laura Kreidberg (http://astro.uchicago.edu/~kreidberg/) and included\nhere with permission.\n",
