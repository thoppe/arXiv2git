For a given atomic crystal image, it contains several tools to identify grain boundary, crystal orientation, elastic deformation. A few examples of synthetic and real atomic crystal images are provided to illustrate how to use these tools.\n\n2. INTRODUCTION\n\nSSTmethod: A collection of MATLAB and MEX routines which applies 2D synchrosqueezed transforms proposed in [1][2] to analyze crystal images. Detailed description of this method is in [4]. An instruction for parameter tuning in the synchrosqueezed transform is in [3]. \n\nVarSSTmethod: A collection of MATLAB and MEX routines which applies a variational model to optimize the crystal analysis results provided by 2D synchrosqueezed transforms. Detailed description of this method is in [5]. \n\n\n[1] H. Yang and L. Ying. Synchrosqueezed wave packet transform for 2d mode decompo- sition.

INSTALLING SYNLAB\n\nrun the file SetPath.m first. It will automatically add all the MATLAB codes to your MATLAB path and compile all MEX files. After this, you can run all demo codes to see how to use this tool box.\n\n4. COPY RIGHT\n\nSynCrystal is copyright reserved.
