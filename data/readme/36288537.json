  "README.md": "# Pupil-detection-and-monitoring-its-motion-\nA module in MATLAB which detects pupil and tracks its motion\n\nIt takes video as input and detect pupil in each frame using 'Viola Jones' algorith for object detection.\n\n\nSteps Involved :-\n1) For Face detection I used standard algo called Viola-Jones. \n\n2) After detecting face, I used Facial Symmetry to detect eyes. Although we can use Viola-Jones again for 'eyes detection' but it would take time so we better make use of symmetry here for eyes.\n\n3) After Eyes Detection, I did some preprocessing like converting RGB to GreyScale.\n \n4) For Pupil Detection, I used Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) Analysis.\n (http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1202/1202.6517.pdf) \n\n5) After Detecting Pupil, I again did some Probing to remove unwanted pixels from the image. For this I perform Erosion and Dilation of image, grouped together all the connected pixels and label them.\n\n6) After completing all the morphological operations, it will give image containing Pupil.\n\n\n",
