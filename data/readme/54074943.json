Functions generating Normal and Poisson entries are provided.\n- testFunctions.R : Provides functions for testing purposes. Unidimensional / Bidimensional scan test function and Monte carlo test for Normal and Poisson families are provided.\n- simulationNormal10/30.R : Generates random matrix with normal entries and elevated anomaly, and compares the testing result between unidimensional / bidimensional scan test; Monte Carlo; and rank methods.\n- simulationPoisson10/30.R : Generates random matrix with Poisson entries and elevated anomaly, and compares the testing result between uni/bidimensional scan test and Monte Carlo.\n- evaluation.R : Generates graphs illustrating the simulation results. R package 'ggplot2' is needed.\n\nReference:\n\nShabalin, A. A., V. J. Weigman, C. M. Perou, and A. B. Nobel (2009). Finding large average submatrices in high dimensional data.
