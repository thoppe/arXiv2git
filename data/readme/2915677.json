States are represented as \ninfinite matrix product states (MPS) invariant under translation by L sites\n(block-translation invariant).\n\nevoMPS finds ground states efficiently, even for critical systems, using the \nnonlinear conjugate gradient method. It computes dispersion relations using\nthe MPS tangent space as ansatz states for low-lying excitations with well-defined momenta.\n\nevoMPS can also simulate nonuniform dynamics in a finite window of an infinite\nsystem.\n\nThe above features set evoMPS apart from other MPS and DMRG software, which do\nnot usually work directly in the thermodynamic limit and do not exploit the MPS \ntangent space as an excitations ansatz. In addition, evoMPS can find ground states\nand simulate real-time dynamics of finite systems with open boundary conditions.\n\nevoMPS is based on algorithms published by Haegeman et al. [1] and Milsted et al. [2],\namong others.\n\nSee the INSTALL file for installation instructions!\n\nKey Features\n------------\n\n* Finds ground states and simulates dynamics of infinite systems\n* Nonlinear conjugate gradient methods for finding ground states in infinite systems\n* Calculates dispersion relations for infinite systems using tangent plane methods\n* Handles locally nonuniform infinite systems (sandwich MPS aka infinite boundary conditions)\n* Time-Dependent Variational Principle for simulating time evolution\n* Runge-Kutta (RK4) and split-step (finite only) integrators for greater accuracy\n* Supports local Hamiltonians: nearest-neighbour (or next-nearest neighbour)\n* Limited support for long range Hamiltonians (in development, currently finite only using MPOs)\n\nUsage\n-----\n\nThe evoMPS algorithms are presented as python classes to be used in a script.\nSome example scripts can be found in the \"examples\" directory.\nTo run an example script without installing the evoMPS modules, copy it to the base \ndirectory first e.g. under Windows::\n    \n    copy examples\\transverse_ising_uniform.py .\n    python transverse_ising_uniform.py\n\nEssentially, the user defines a spin chain Hilbert space\nand a nearest-neighbour Hamiltonian and then carries out a series of small \ntime steps (numerically integrating the effective Schrodinger equation for the MPS parameters)::\n\n    sim = EvoMPS_TDVP_Uniform(bond_dim, local_hilb_dim, my_hamiltonian)\n    \n    for i in range(max_steps):\n        sim.update()\n        \n        my_exp_val = sim.expect_1s(my_op)\n        \n        sim.take_step_RK4(dtau)\n\nOperators, including the Hamiltonian, are defined as arrays like this::\n\n    pauli_z = numpy.array([[1, 0],\n                           [0, -1]])\n\nCalculating expectation values or other quantities can be done after each step \nas desired.\n\nSwitching between imaginary time evolution (for finding the ground state)\nand real time evolution is as easy as multiplying the time step size by a factor of i!\n\nContact\n-------\n\nPlease send comments to:\n\nashmilsted at <google's well-known email service>\n\nTo submit ideas or bug reports, please use the GitHub Issues system <http://github.com/amilsted/evoMPS/>.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n1. \\J.
