  "description": "Julia code for ABC, SMIL and CU-II estimation of a structural auction model", 
  "README.md": "This directory contains the code estimate the auction model\nin \"Indirect Likelihood Inference\", by Michael Creel and Dennis\nKristensen. The 2013 version of the paper used simple sampling\nfrom the prior. This version of code uses adaptive importance\nsampling, as described in Creel and Kristensen, CS&DA, 2015, \nand local linear smoothing, as in Creel, Gao, Hong and Kristensen \"Bayesian Indirect Inference and the ABC of GMM\" http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.07385\nWith far fewer simulations, better results are obtained.\n\nThe code also allows computation of the \"SMIL\" and CU-II\nestimators.\n\nThe code is written for Julia, and was run using a git checkout\nof the development version, version\n0.4.0-dev+5041 (2015-05-27 11:11 UTC).\n\nIn addition to core Julia, you need the Distances, Distributions,\nOptim, and MPI packages. To install the Distances package, execute\nPkg.add(\"Distances\") from the Julia prompt. Do the same for the\nother packages.\n\nTo install the MPI package, you will need cmake, Open MPI, and\nprobably other development tools. Keep executing Pkg.add(\"MPI\"),\nsolving problems, and trying again, until you succeed.\n\nThen, you can run the code (either SMIL or SBIL) by executing\n\nmpirun -np 21 julia AuctionMC.jl\n\nin either of the two subdirectories, one for SBIL, one for SMIL.\n\nReplace the 21 above with the appropriate number of MPI ranks,\ngiven your hardware. For a 32 core machine, 21 works pretty well.\nSetting the number too high gives a cache contention slowdown.\n",
