  "README": "This is the MPTP2078 benchmark for automated reasoning in large theories (ARLT).\n\nThere are 2078 problems in the benchmark, created by the MPTP system\nfrom 33 Mizar articles leading to the proof of the Bolzano-Weierstrass\ntheorem. The MML version used is 7.11.07_4.156.1112\n(ftp://mizar.uwb.edu.pl/pub/system/i386-linux/mizar-7.11.07_4.156.1112-i386-linux.tar).\n\nFor copyright and copying information, see the files COPYING* in this\ndirectory. The paper about the benchmark is now available as pre-print\nat http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.3446 . Use the published (probably JAR)\nversion for citation when it appears.\n\n\nFiles:\n\nchainy/*: (packed to chainy.tar.7z in the github version)\n\n  The 2078 problems with all previous knowledge included (the large,\n  hard problems). This emulates the scenario of proving new\n  conjectures over a large mathematical library.\n\n\nchainy_incl/*\n\n  Same as chainy, but using the TPTP inclusion directive.\n\n\nbushy/*:\n\n  The 2078 problems with as little dependencies as possible, computed\n  by the Mizar dependency analysis. This emulates the scenario when\n  knowledgable users select the premises for a new conjecture\n  manually, and ask ATPs to find a proof.\n\n\nheaders/*\n\n  TPTP header information for the problems, specifying the author,\n  problem, article, and domain.\n\n\nBibliography:\n\n  Bibliographical information about the Mizar articles used.\n\n\nArticlesInMMLOrder:\n\n  List of the 33 articles used in their MML order.\n\n\nProblemsInMMLOrder:\n\n  List of the 2078 problems in their MML order.\n\n\nCOPYING*:\n \n  Copying and copyright information.\n\n\n\nHave fun!\n\nJosef Urban\nfirstname@lastname@gmail.com\n",
