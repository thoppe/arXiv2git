  "README.md": "# Big-step normalization (formalized in Agda)\n\nThis is a result of refactoring James Chapman's repository\n<https://github.com/jmchapman/Big-step-Normalisation>,\nwhose README says:\n\n\n> \"This repo contains recently updated formalisations of BSN\n(<http://cs.ioc.ee/~james/BSN.html>). There are three directories for\ndifferent calculi in each directory is an Everything.agda. The best\ndocumentation for this is my this which you can find at the url above.\"\n\nThe purposes of the refactoring:\n\n* To make some proof more human-friendly by exploiting the resources of the Standard Library (such as \"equational reasoning\").\n* To rewrite the proof of soundness by replacing functions with\nrelations, in order to make Agda accept it. Now the horrible annotations\n**{-# TERMINATING #-}** are not used any more. The original proof, however,\nis easier to understand, and can be considered as a draft of the final proof.\n\n## References\n\n* Thierry Coquand and Peter Dybjer. 1997.\n**Intuitionistic model constructions and normalization proofs.**\nMathematical.
