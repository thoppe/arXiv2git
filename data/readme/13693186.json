  "description": "C# Binding of the BWA MEM program, giving programmatic access and returning .NET Bio objects.", 
  "README.md": "[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/evolvedmicrobe/BWA-Sharp.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/evolvedmicrobe/BWA-Sharp)\n\n###Description\n\nThis library is a C# wrapper around the bwa mem program.  It allows C# (or python or F#) code to call BWA from obtain fully typed SAMAlignment object compatible with .NET Bio classes.  It differs from previous wrappers around this program as it does not require the user to run the \"index\" command prior to calling this program, and also does not do the interop through a C++ intermediate.  \n\nBwa mem was originally written by Heng Li and is available at: http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/.  BWA was released under GPLv3, which I trust was a good choice, and so this license also applies to this code. \n\nThis C# library comes as a .dll file.  This file depends on a shared library that is compiled by gcc as 64 bit.  To use on 32 bit systems the user must alter the make file appropriately.\n\nBecause the original BWA program has a dependencies on linux, this library only works on posix systems that are little endian and are executing as 64 bit programs.\n\n###Getting started\n\t//Create and query\n\tvar bwa =new BWA(\"myFile.fasta\");\n\tvar query = new Sequence(DnaAlphabet.Instance,\"CGCATTCCTACTACTCAACTTAAA\");\n\tvar res = bwa.AlignSequence(query);\n\t//Free unmanaged resources\n\tbwa.Dispose()\n\n###Citing the original BWA\n\n* Li H. and Durbin R.
