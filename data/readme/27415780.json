This project\nimplements that model in python and can be used to generate random road network of varying sizes.\n\n## QuadTree implementation\nThe main component of the model is the Quadtree data structure. Quadtree is a tree data structure similar\nto a binary tree with the difference that each node could have up to four children instead of two. In this\nimplementation each node either has four children or no children. The first node in the tree forms the initial\nplane. Each node in the tree represents a square and its four children represent the division of the square\ninto four quadrants. Squares are added to the tree by recursively dividing squares into four quadrants.\n\n## Road network and coordinate generation\nEach node in the tree represents a square in a plane. For a given number n of nodes, the squares are randomly divided\ninto four quadrants, i.e. add four children to leaf nodes in the QuadTree. Each edge of the square forms\na road connecting two points. The Point class represents a point in the 2 dimensional\nspace. The Point class implements Python's standard comparison, hash methods and also a method to\ncalculate euclidean distance to another point in the same plane. Once the desired number of squares are\ngenerated, the tree is recursively traversed to generate Points based on the box formed\nby the squares in the tree. From these Points a list of edges are generated and the euclidean\ndistance between them are calculated. Additionally, there are utility methods to perform Breadth First Search, add\nnodes to specific nodes in the tree and print statistics. To visualize the generated road network there is\na utility to plot the network using Matplotlib\n\nLicense: MIT License\n\n[Eis10] David Eisenstat. \"Random road networks: the quadtree model\".
