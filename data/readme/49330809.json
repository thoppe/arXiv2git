It means that the agent \ndoes not predict the future but the present. This version has already been \nimproved. It really predicts the future. It can be verify in [SamuLife](https://github.com/nbatfai/SamuLife)\n\n[https://youtu.be/yOZj6j1kVRg](https://youtu.be/yOZj6j1kVRg)\n\n## Other experiments\n\nSamu (Nahshon)\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02889,\nhttps://github.com/nbatfai/nahshon\n\n---\n\nSamuLife\nhttps://github.com/nbatfai/SamuLife,\nhttps://youtu.be/b60m__3I-UM\n\nSamuMovie\nhttps://github.com/nbatfai/SamuMovie,\nhttps://youtu.be/XOPORbI1hz4\n\nSamuStroop\nhttps://github.com/nbatfai/SamuStroop,\nhttps://youtu.be/6elIla_bIrw,\nhttps://youtu.be/VujHHeYuzIk\n\nSamuBrain\nhttps://github.com/nbatfai/SamuBrain\n\nSamuCopy\nhttps://github.com/nbatfai/SamuCopy\n\n---\n\nSamuTicker\nhttps://github.com/nbatfai/SamuTicker\n\nSamuVocab\nhttps://github.com/nbatfai/SamuVocab",
