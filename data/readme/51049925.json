[facetune](http://www.facetuneapp.com/)\n2. [retouch](http://www.colorpilot.com/retouch.html)\n3. [retoucher](http://akvis.com/en/retoucher/index.php)\n\n## Ideas\n* Inspired by the network in network architecture proprosed by GoogLeNet as well as the R-CNN transition to faster-R-CNN, we want to design an architecture of the network based on the Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN) and convert the pipline of photo restoration within the network. For inpainting, we've found two CNN related papers.  \n\n* For inpainting to work, our algorithm need to apply inpainting from the nearest neighbor of the missing part or creases, inpainting will not work if the area is big, in other words, our algorithm need to shrink the size of user defined problematic area until it's good enough to do inpainting.\n\n* GAN in the sense generator now is the restored instance of image and discriminator classify whether current  restored instance is a good repairing. The problem is this network needs so many data to train the generator at least, but we can have databases of faces and fake the problematic area.\n\n* Train faster RCNN to detect problematic area of the image in real time.(TODO: solve let the user select the area to fix)\n##Our Approach\n1. Non-face\n\t* Small tears, folds:Image Inpainting [4]\n\t* Missing patches:\n\t\t* Fragment-based Image Completion[8]\n\t\t* Scene completion(background?) \n2. Face\n\t* Non-fine-grained features(cheeks, forehead):\n\t\t* Small (Image Inpainting [4])\n\t\t* Patch (Segmented-based image completion[8])\n\t* Fine-grained features (Missing patches):\n\t\t* Graph Laplace for Occluded Face Completion[6][7]\n\t\t* Stronger conditional Generative Adversarial Network [5]\n\t\t* The condition is no longer semantic description of faces like age or races, but the faces with \"problematic\" area.\n\n\n## resources might be useful\n\n#### general ideas\n2.
