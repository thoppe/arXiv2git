Presently, some of our code is under-tested.  In that\n  case, we should manually verify how well our code works and plan to add\n  the necessary integration tests.  `master` should always be at or ahead\n  any software or data that has been deployed to a standard clustered environment.\n\n## Tags\n\n### Pipeline Run\n\nWe will push tags marking the latest successful run over a given corpus.  The\ntags take the form `pipeline-run-2015.XX.YY` where `XX` is the month and `YY`\nis the day.  Tags will have release notes associated with them.\n\n## Running a Pipeline\n\n1.  Generate a new data snapshots from the Daq.\n2.  Kick off a full pipeline run via nixops.\n3.  Update the elastic search index, service layer, and demo.\n",
