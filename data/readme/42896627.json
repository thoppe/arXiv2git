If the readers want to get the latest version, please download from the webpages above.\n\nInstallation instructions:\n\n1.\tInstall the CVX package from http://web.cvxr.com/cvx/doc/  and include the folders in MATLAB's path.\n\n2.\tInstall the GAMP software packages from http://sourceforge.net/projects/gampmatlab/files/  and include the folders in MATLAB's path\n\n3.\tThe multi-view dataset can be downloaded from http://www.fujii.nuee.nagoya-u.ac.jp/multiview-data/ .\n\n\n\nHow to use SI-OWLQN:\n\nSave the data into .mtx format ,e.g., \n[ err1 ] = mmwrite( 'A_matrix.mtx',A); % %\n\n[ err2 ] = mmwrite( 'y_matrix.mtx',Y); %\n\n[ err3 ] = mmwrite( 'SI_matrix.mtx',x_SI); %\n\n[ err4 ] = mmwrite('x_matrix.mtx',x);\n\nThe mmwrite and mmread programme have been included in sub-folder \"solver\".\n\ncd to comparison algorithms\\SI-OWLQN\n\nThe input format should be like this:\n\nSI-OWLQN  x_matrix.mtx  A_matrix.mtx  y_matrix.mtx  SI_matrix.mtx  lambda  output.mtx  -l2weight  tau\n\nThen mmread function is applied to read output.mtx into matlab and the MSE can be calculated.\n\n\n\n",
