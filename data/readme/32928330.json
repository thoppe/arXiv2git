No guarantees are given for the correctness or completeness of this experimental version.\n\n# Paper Now README\n\nCreate, edit and (optionally) display a journal article, entirely in GitHub.\n\nIn contrast to the more traditional process of `submit > peer-review > publish` at [PeerJ](https://peerj.com), or even the less formal preprints at _PeerJ Preprints_ or _arXiv_, _Paper Now_ is an experiment to see where the future may go with scholarly communication. Initially, it may be that co-authors collaborate either privately or publicly on GitHub and then proceed to submitting to PeerJ or other journals for formal peer-review or preprinting. Or perhaps this is where the traditional medium of publication begins to diverge. There is no end goal other than to see what the academic community wants, which is why this is completely open to fork, extend, and build upon.\n\n[See an example article](https://peerj.github.io/paper-now/)\n\n## Instructions\n\n1. [Fork this repository to your own account](https://github.com/peerj/paper-now/fork)\n1. [Edit the article metadata](index.md)\n1. Add [data](data)*, [figures](_figures) and [tables](_tables)\n1. [Edit each section](_sections)\n1. [View your article](https://peerj.github.io/paper-now/) in GitHub Pages at https://{username}.github.io/paper-now\n\n## Notes\n\n* Paper Now is at a very experimental stage; it may progress further if people find it useful.\n* Paper Now is inspired by [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).\n* If you rename your forked repository, you also need to change the `baseurl` setting in [_config.yml](_config.yml) to match.\n* It's not possible to fork the same repository twice in GitHub, so to create a second article you'll need to create a new repository in GitHub, clone this repository locally and push it to your new repository.\n* *There isn't currently a way to upload binary files using GitHub's web interface, so you'll need to do this locally. [GitHub's desktop client](https://guides.github.com/introduction/getting-your-project-on-github/#desktop) is probably the easiest way to clone a repository, add files and push the changes back to GitHub.\n\n## Feedback\n\n* Does this article structure make sense? Would it be better all in one file? [Create an issue](https://github.com/peerj/paper-now/issues) to discuss it.\n* Made changes to the layout templates or some other part of the code? [Send a pull request](https://github.com/peerj/paper-now/pulls).\n",
