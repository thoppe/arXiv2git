  "README.md": "# QuickSearch\n\n> Note: This code has recently been converted to a Rails Gem Engine. It is encouraged that you use this version, but if you are\n> looking for the original release of QuickSearch as a standalone Rails project, it can be found here:\n> https://github.com/NCSU-Libraries/quick_search/tree/pre-gem\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/NCSU-Libraries/quick_search.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/NCSU-Libraries/quick_search)\n[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/quick_search-core.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/quick_search-core)\n\nQuickSearch is a customized federated search tool designed to connect people to a variety of library resources, services, and tools. QuickSearch is designed to complement and increase use of existing dedicated library resource discovery tools, such as the catalog, electronic resource search, and subject guides/portals, by directing people to them via an intuitive search interface. The aim of QuickSearch is to provide people with a quick and easy way to find the information they need.\n\nFor more information about NCSU Libraries' QuickSearch and the history of the project, see: http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/reports/quicksearch\n\nFor NCSU Libraries' implementation of QuickSearch, see:\nhttp://search.lib.ncsu.edu\n\n## Features\n\n- Single search with bento-box style results\n- Modular\n  - swap out searcher modules and themes easily\n  - choose from a variety of existing searchers or create your own\n- Best Bets\n- Search analytics\n\n## Disclaimer\n\nThis code has been extracted from the code we have been running in\nproduction, but still should be considered an early release.\n\n## Installation\n\nThe aim of QuickSearch is to make it very easy to get up and running. There are several ways that you can go about installing it, depending on your situation.\n\n### Vagrant\n\nIf you're interested in trying out QuickSearch, or you're a developer looking to get a development environment up and running, the easiest way is to use Vagrant to create a virtual environment which automatically installs QuickSearch and its dependencies in only a couple easy steps.\n\nThis method uses Ansible playbooks to provision the virtual environment\nand install QuickSearch, so it is a good guide to see how you might\nconfigure a server for a QuickSearch production envrionment.\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\n- Vagrant 1.8+ (http://www.vagrantup.com)\n- VirtualBox (https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)\n\n#### Instructions\n\n##### Clone this repository\n\n    git clone git@github.com:ncsu-libraries/quick_search\n\n##### Change into the cloned directory\n\n    cd quick_search\n\n##### Run\n\n    vagrant up\n\n> Note: sometimes the provisioning process will hang at the \"dev-bundle |\nbundle install\" step. If this happens, press Ctrl+C to kill the process,\nthen run the following command to continue the provisioning process:\n\n    vagrant provision\n\n#####Once this completes, you'll have a running instance of QuickSearch available at http://localhost:8888/\n\n### Manual Installation\n\nFollow these instructions to manually install QuickSearch for\ndevelopment.\n\n#### Prerequisites\n\n- Rails 4.1\n- Ruby 2.1\n- MySQL development headers (mysql-devel package on CentOS)\n- qtwebkit development headers (qtwebkit-devel package on CentOS)\n\n#### Instructions\n\n##### Create a new Rails app, cd into the directory:\n\n    rails new my_app\n\n    ...\n\n    cd my_app\n\n##### Add quick_search_core gem to your Gemfile:\n\n    gem 'quick_search-core'\n\n> For development, use: gem 'quick_search-core', git: 'git://github.com/NCSU-Libraries/quick_search.git'\n\n##### Run 'bundle install'\n\n##### Run the QuickSearch installation generator:\n\n    bundle exec rails generate quick_search:install\n\nThe generator will install the generic QuickSearch theme, and some\nsearchers that will work out of the box. For more information on further\nconfiguring QuickSearch, see: [Configuring QuickSearch](docs/configuration.md)\n\n##### Start the server:\n\n    bundle exec rails s\n\n##### QuickSearch will be available at http://localhost:3000/\n\n## Documentation\n\nFind more in-depth documentation about QuickSearch in the [docs\ndirectory](docs/README.md)\n\n## Customizing QuickSearch\n\nQuickSearch is built in a modular way, and is easy to modify or extend.\nFor more in-depth documentation about this, see:\n\n- [Customizing QuickSearch Searchers](docs/customizing_searchers.md)\n- [Customizing QuickSearch Themes](docs/customizing_themes.md)\n\n### Searchers\n\nHere are a list of searchers that have been created for QuickSearch so\nfar.
