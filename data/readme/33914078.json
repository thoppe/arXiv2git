They will transmit information about humans by squawking.\n\n[![wercker status](https://app.wercker.com/status/b41e1151f67e8c92d1ddf75ac2ea3ec9/m \"wercker status\")](https://app.wercker.com/project/bykey/b41e1151f67e8c92d1ddf75ac2ea3ec9)\n\n[![Stories in Ready](https://badge.waffle.io/rolandpoulter/murder.png)](https://waffle.io/rolandpoulter/murder)\n\n>  NOTE: If you are viewing this from GitHub or NPM, try viewing it from the\n>  [documentation site](http://rolandpoulter.github.io/murder/docs/README.html)\n\nMurder is based mainly on Swarm. I wanted an easier API, and better documentation. I also wanted the code to be much simpler than Swarm, like the crdt npm module. I also wanted state changes to acknowledge that they've been distributed with promises.\n\n>  NOTE: Existing source adapters are implemented against node modules that\n>  are written in pure JavaScript so that they do not require a compile step.\n>  This was done to make murder more portable. It is easy to write custom\n>  source adapters that use modules which depend on compiled extensions.\n\n# Docs\n\nAPI methods are specified in the documentation in two ways:\n1. `Object.method()` -- Describes a class level method or a module method.\n2. `Object:method()` -- Describes a method on the prototype of the `Object`. This is a shorthand for `Object.prototype.method()` in the documentation.\n\n```javascript\nvar myDocument = new Model('id', 'author', [localStorage, remoteSource]);\nmyDocument.sync().then(function () {\n  myDocument.change({key: 'value'}).then(function () {\n    console.log('done');\n  });\n});\n```\n\nThis project is designed to run on a Tessel. In order to meet this requirement no compiled dependencies are used.\n\n* https://github.com/collin/crdt\n* https://github.com/dominictarr/crdt\n* https://github.com/rkusa/or-set\n* https://github.com/gritzko/swarm\n* http://book.mixu.net/distsys/eventual.html\n* http://research.microsoft.com/apps/video/default.aspx?id=153540&r=1\n* https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/file/index/docid/397981/filename/RR-6956.pdf\n* http://hal.upmc.fr/file/index/docid/555588/filename/techreport.pdf\n* http://arxiv.org/pdf/1210.3368v1.pdf\n* http://christophermeiklejohn.com/crdt/2014/07/22/readings-in-crdts.html\n* https://github.com/soundcloud/roshi#crdt\n\n* https://github.com/louischatriot/nedb#compacting-the-database\n\n## ISC LICENSE\n\n*Copyright (c) 2015, Roland Poulter <rolandpoulter@gmail.com>*\n\nPermission to use, copy, modify, and/or distribute this software for any purpose with or without fee is hereby granted, provided that the above copyright notice and this permission notice appear in all copies.\n\n**THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\" AND THE AUTHOR DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES WITH REGARD TO THIS SOFTWARE INCLUDING ALL IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS.
