It is intently kept small to stay reliable and understandable.\n\nSferes2 heavily relies on template-based meta-programming in C++ to get both abstraction and execution speed.\n\n**If you use this software in an academic article, please cite:**\n\nMouret, J.-B. and Doncieux, S.

It successfully compiles with gcc, clang and icc (if it is not the case, please file a bug report in the issue tracker).\n\n\nAuthor\n-------\n- Jean-Baptiste Mouret mouret@isir.upmc.frfr: main author and maintainer\n\nOther contributors\n------------\n- Stephane Doncieux doncieux@isir.upmc.fr\n- Paul Tonelli tonelli@isir.upmc.fr (documentation)\n- Many members of ISIR (http://isir.upmc.fr)\n\nPeer-reviewed academic papers that used Sferes2:\n------------------------------------------------\n*If you used Sferes2 in an academic paper, please send us an e-mail (mouret@isir.upmc.fr) so that we can add it here!*\n\n(you can find a pdf for most of these publications on http://scholar.google.com).\n\n### 2016\n- Tarapore, D.
