Another blog post describes how to create that.\n\nThere are two python files here. \nrun-sciml-to-eventhub.py assembles a set of the ARXIV document records and sends them to the event hub.\npull-events-from-eventhub-through-queue.py which pulls events from the event hub, invokes the azureml service\nand then saves the response in the table.\n\nthe event puller can be run as a standalone python program anywhere or it can be run in a docker contianer.\nthe Dockerfile for the container is included here.    When invoked it must be supplied with one integer\nparameter in the range 0 to 3 to identify which azureml service endpoint to use.   \n\nMore details in the blog post.\n",
