  "README.md": "# SatConn\nResearch tools for connectivity-related problems of Boolean satisfiability\n\nThis software was written as part of the research for my PhD thesis \"Connectivity of Boolean Satisfiability\" in theoretical computer science at the university of Hannover, Germany. See http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.06700.\n\nAfter downloading the complete repository, the folder can be opened resp. imported in Netbeans or Eclipse as a project. The most useful functions are declared public and equipped with Javadoc comments, where helpful. The main-functions provide usage examples and can be executed by running the respective file.\n\nIncluded is a graphical tool to draw solution graphs of Boolean formulas on hypercube projections, which is provided also as executable (SatConnTool.jar).\n\nThe software is licensed under the GPL, version 2. Some of it may be useful for future work on related problems.\n",
