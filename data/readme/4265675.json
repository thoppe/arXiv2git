Phase Resetting in an Asymptotically\nPhaseless System: On the Phase Response of Limit Cycles Verging on a\nHeteroclinic Orbit. SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems 2012;11:350\u2013391.\n\nPublished version: http://epubs.siam.org/siads/resource/1/sjaday/v11/i1/p350_s1\n\nPreprint (freely downloadable): http://arxiv.org/abs/1103.5647\n\nTo generate the various figures from the paper, you will need to run the following commands:\n\n    python generate_figures.py\n    python generate_figures_ml.py\n    octave irisprc_coupling_check.m\n\nTo generate the movies from the paper, you will need to run\n\n    python generate_movies.py\n\nNote that these scripts require the user to have installed python 2.6 or above,\nscipy, matplotlib, mencoder, and mplex.\n",
