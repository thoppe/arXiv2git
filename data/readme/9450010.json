It is designed to illustrate a constrained transport algorithm -- which is described in this paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.3609 -- which ensures that the magnetic field remains divergence-free. \n\n\nUsage\n-----\n- A quick start guide can be found in readmes/quickstart.txt\n- A list of subroutines/functions can be found in readmes/contents.txt\n\n\nLicense\n-------\nMagneto is released under the GNU General Public License (version 3, or -- at your option -- any later version), details of which can be found in the header of each file and in readmes/gpl-license.txt.
