Howe\nPackaged July 2004\nPortions of code copyright Andrew Goldberg (see notice below)\n\nThis package comes with no warranty of any kind.\n\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nThe files in this package comprise the Matlab implementation of a\nforeground segmentation algorithm based upon graph cuts, described in:\n\nBetter Foreground Segmentation Through Graph Cuts, N. Howe &\nA. Deschamps.  Tech report, http://arxiv.org/abs/cs.CV/0401017.\n\nThe file extractForeground.m contains a sample function that will\nperform a complete foreground segmentation for static camera video.\nIt uses a number of parameters, which are described in the\ndocumentation.  An attempt was made to choose sensible default values,\nbut they may need to be adjusted for some videos.\n\nMore generally, the implementation in extractForeground.m is only a\nsuggestion of how the graph-based segmentation might be used.  The\nsame approach can be applied with other (perhaps time-adaptive)\nbackground models.  The key step is at line 113 of the code, once the\ndeviation array has been created.  The graph-cut segmentation can be\napplied similarly to a deviation matrix computed in any other way.\n\n\nCopyright Notice\n----------------\n\nThe files included by gcut.cpp come from the Network Optimization\nLibrary created by Andrew Goldberg\n(http://www.avglab.com/andrew/soft.html).
