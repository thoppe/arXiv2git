Due the dynamic nature of the List sort, it becomes much more fast than some conventional comparison sorting techniques and comparable to Quick Sort and Merge Sort. List sort takes the advantage of the data which is already sorted either in ascending order or in descending order. \n\nKeywords:\n=========\ncomparison sort; complexity; algorithm; list;\n\n\n\nAuthors:\n========\n\nAdarsh Kumar Verma\nhttps://www.facebook.com/adarsh.verma.5688\n\nPrashant Kumar\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pkswatch\n",
