Make sure you have FastJet (fastjet-config should be in your path),\n   at least version 3.1.0, fastjet contrib version > 1.014 (should be\n   installed to the same location as fastjet) and the Boost C++ library.\n\n2. Get the lightweight event-analysis framework from the [Pileup 2014\n   workshop](https://indico.cern.ch/event/306155/): in some directory,\n   do the following\n\n        git clone https://github.com/PileupWorkshop/2014PileupWorkshop.git\n        cd 2014PileupWorkshop/Framework\n        ./mkmk\n        make \n\n   (If you already got a copy from the pileup workshop in May 2014,\n   update it, because we use some new features added since then)\n\n3. Then edit the file mkmk in this directory (the same as this\n   README.md file) so that PU14CODE points to the location of the\n   pileup workshop top-level directory. Then build things with\n\n        ./mkmk\n        make\n\n   On a Mac, if you got Boost from some source other than macports,\n   you may need to edit the parts that point to /opt/local.\n\n4. Get some event files. These are at\n   http://puws2014.web.cern.ch/puws2014/events/ and also on afs at\n   /afs/cern.ch/user/p/puws2014/public/events/\n\n   You will need at least:\n\n   - http://puws2014.web.cern.ch/puws2014/events/lhc14-pythia8-4C-Zprime500-nobdecay-noUE-nev1e5.pu14.gz\n   - http://puws2014.web.cern.ch/puws2014/events/lhc14-pythia8-4C-minbias-nev1e6.pu14.gz\n\nThen you're ready to run. You can get most of the CHS results with a\ncommand such as the following\n\n        ./baseline  -chs -massless \\\n          -hard events/lhc14-pythia8-4C-Zprime500-nobdecay-noUE-nev1e5.pu14.gz \\\n          -pileup events/lhc14-pythia8-4C-minbias-nev1e6.pu14.gz \\\n          -npu 100 -nev 100 -out results.txt\n\nwhere events/ is the directory that contains the event files (or a\nsymbolic link to it).\n\n100 events (-nev 100) won't give you very reliable answers but should\nrun in 15-30s. The -npu 100 flag adds exactly 100 pileup events to\neach hard event.\n\nTo start getting numerically stable results you should increase the\nnumber of events to at least 10000. The results should then agree with\nthose in\n\n  file:reference-results-npu100.txt\n\n(if you need more than 10k events, download a larger minbias file).\n\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------\nReproducing results in arXiv:1407.0408v2\n========================================\n\nCreate a directory results/ and then try out the following commands in\norder to get a subset of the results shown in the paper.\n\nThe code used to generate the actual plots in the paper was mostly\ndifferent from the code in this directory here. We believe that the\nresults are consistent across codes.\n\nAlso some minor details of the running were different between what's given\nhere and what is given below. In particular, fig.4 (correlation\ncoefficients v. NPU) in the paper is given for bins of NPU ranging\ne.g. from 1-10, 11-20, etc., whereas the program runs just for a\nsingle fixed pileup.\n\nFinally, to run the examples below, you'll need a wider range of event\nfiles (all should be in the same directory linked to above).\n\n## Figure 4 (correlation coefficient for Z' decay versus NPU)\n\nRun commands such as the following (with and without B's in the Z' decay)\n\n    ./baseline -nev 100000 -chs -massless \\\n               -pileup events/lhc14-pythia8-4C-minbias-nev1e7.pu14.gz -npu 105 \\\n               -hard events/lhc14-pythia8-4C-Zprime500-nobdecay-noUE-nev1e5.pu14.gz \\\n               -out results/Zp500-npu105.res\n\n    ./baseline -nev 100000 -chs -massless \\\n               -pileup events/lhc14-pythia8-4C-minbias-nev1e7.pu14.gz -npu 105 \\\n               -hard events/lhc14-pythia8-4C-Zprime2uds500-nobdecay-noUE-nev1e5.pu14.gz \\\n               -out results/Zp500uds-npu105.res\n\nYou'll need to scan over the \"-npu 105\" argument to get the full range\nof number of pileup events.\n\nThe reference results for the first command are in file:ref-results/Zp500-npu105.res\n\n## Figure 5 (\"fingerprint\" plots for Z' events)\n\nThe same, but replacing \"-npu 105\" with \"-upu 140\" (and changing the\noutput file name). Just a single run is needed since the -upu argument\ngives pileup distributed uniformly over the range 1..140.\n\nNote that the program only outputs dispersions, not the 90% width\ninformation. For that you'd need to extend the program to write out\nhistograms or ntuples and deduce the 90% width from those.\n\n## Figure 6 (50GeV dijets with R=0.4 jets)\n\nRun the following:\n\n    ./baseline -nev 100000 -chs -massless \\\n               -pileup events/lhc14-pythia8-4C-minbias-nev1e7.pu14.gz -upu 140 \\\n               -hard events/lhc14-pythia8-4C-dijetsel50-noUE-nevsel1e5.pu14.gz \\\n               -R 0.4 -Rsub 0.2 -jet-ptmin 50 \\\n               -out results/dijets50-R04-Rsub02-upu140.res\n\n## Figure 7 (WW with f=0.05 trimmed R=1 jets)\n\nRun\n\n    ./baseline -nev 100000 -chs -massless \\\n               -pileup events/lhc14-pythia8-4C-minbias-nev1e7.pu14.gz -upu 140 \\\n               -hard events/lhc14-pythia8-4C-WW500-noUE-nev1e5.pu14.gz \\\n               -jet-ptmin 500 -fcut 0.05 \\\n               -out results/WW500-fcut05-upu140.res\n\nNote that this run (which recycles a hard event file taken from the 2014\nPileup Workshop) differs slightly from that in the paper, where the\ngeneration cut for the events is 450 GeV (here it is 500 GeV). Both\napply a 500 GeV jet selection cut.\n\n",
