  "README.md": "Deep Face Representation \n===================\n\nOverview\n-----------\n\nThis Deep Face Representation Experiment is based on Convolution Neural Network to learn a robust feature for face verification task. The popular deep learning framework [<i>caffe</i>][1] is used for training on [CASIA-WebFace dataset][2]  and the feature extraction is realized by python code [<i>caffe_ftr.py</i>][3].\n\nStructure\n-------------\n<i class=\"icon-folder-open\"></i>code:  data pre-processing and evaluation code.<br>\n<i class=\"icon-folder-open\"></i>model: caffemodel and solverstate.<br>\n<i class=\"icon-folder-open\"></i>proto: convolution network configuration. <br>\n<i class=\"icon-folder-open\"></i>results: LFW features.<br>\n\n\nDescription\n-------------\nData Pre-processing\n\n>1). Download CASIA-WebFace dataset which contains 493456 face images of 10575 identities. <br>\n>2). All face images are converted to gray-scale images and normalized to 144x144 according to landmarks.<br>\n>3). According to the 5 facial points, we not only rotate two eye points horizontally but also set the distance between the midpoint of eyes and the midpoint of mouth(ec_mc_y), and the y axis of midpoint of eyes(ec_y) .<br>\n\n   Dataset     | size    |  ec_mc_y  | ec_y  \n  :----| :-----: | :----:    | :----: \n  CASIA-WebFace | 144x144 |     48    | 48    \n  lfw           | 128x128 |     48    | 40    \n\nTraining\n>1). The model is trained by open source deep learning framework <i>caffe</i>.<br>\n>2). The network configuration is showed in \"proto\" file and the trained model is showed in \"model\" file.<br>\n\nEvaluation\n>1). The model is evaluated on LFW data set which is a popular data set for face verification task.<br>\n>2). The feature extraction is used by python program [<i>caffe_ftr.py</i>][3]. The extracted features and lfw testing pairs are located in \"results\" file.<br>\n>3). To evaluate the model, the [matlab code][4] or other ROC evaluation code can be used. <br>\n\nResults\n\n  The single convolution net testing is evaluated on unsupervised setting only computing cosine similarity for lfw pairs.   \n\n|   Dataset   | EER | TPR@FPR(FAR)=1%   | TPR@FPR(FAR)=0.1%| TPR@FPR(FAR)=0| Rank-1| DIR@FAR=1%|\n| :------- | :----: | :---: | :---: |:---: | :---: |:---: |\n| A | 97.77% |  94.80% | 84.37%| 43.17%| 84.79%| 63.09%|\n| B | 98.13% |    96.73%    |    87.13%  |    64.33%  |   89.21%   |   69.46%   |\n\nThe details are published as a technical report on [arXiv][5]. \nIf you use our models, please cite the following paper:\n\n\t@article{wu2015lightened,\n\t  title={A Lightened CNN for Deep Face Representation},\n\t  author={Wu, Xiang and He, Ran and Sun, Zhenan},\n\t  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.02683},\n\t  year={2015}\n\t}\n\t@article{wu2015learning,\n\t  title={Learning Robust Deep Face Representation},\n\t  author={Wu, Xiang},\n\t  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1507.04844},\n\t  year={2015}\n\t}\n\n**The released models are only allowed for non-commercial use.**\n\n  [1]: https://github.com/AlfredXiangWu/caffe\n  [2]: http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/english/CASIA-WebFace-Database.html\n  [3]: https://github.com/AlfredXiangWu/python_misc/blob/master/caffe/caffe_ftr.py\n  [4]: https://github.com/AlfredXiangWu/lfw_face_verification_experiment/blob/master/code/evaluation.m\n  [5]: http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02683\n  \n\n",
