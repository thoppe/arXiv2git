Email help@xsede.org to obtain your autogenerated trestles password, then change it at https://passive.sdsc.edu/\n* ```ssh username@trestles-login1.sdsc.edu``` providing your trestles-specific password. This allows you to specify which of trestles' three login servers to use. \n\n#### software:\nfind already installed software packages by running ```module avail```\n\nif you can't find a dependency you need by ```module avail```, you can either\n\n* install it yourself in your home directory. \n* ask help@xsede.org to install it for you (especially if it's a generally useful tool); expect delays. also, they don't always agree :-/\n\n#### running jobs:\nfor trivial jobs (e.g. compiling, bleu) can be directly run on the trestles login machine.\n\nuse ```qsub```, specifying one of two queues: ```-q normal``` which gives exclusive access to nodes, or ```-q shared``` which gives shared access to nodes (e.g. allows you to request only 8 out of the 32 cores on a node; useful for running a debugger on the same node). \n\nyou can run interactive jobs as follows ```qsub -I -q normal -l nodes=1:ppn=32,walltime=48:00:00```. 48 is the maximum number of hours you can request for interactive jobs. in order to avoid losing your job if the login server closes your ssh connection (e.g. due to long inactivity), you can login to a specific login server and start a ```/home/diag/glock/user/screen/bin/screen``` session before submitting the ```qsub -I``` job.\n\n\n#### hardware configurations:\ntrestle consists of about 10K nodes, each has 32 cores and 64GB of RAM (as well as 120GB of flash disk memory which is much slower than RAM but much faster than regular disk). \n\n#### where to write files?\n```/home/$USER``` (backed up; max 10gb; use for your source code/binaries; don't use for data). note: you would think each user has a home directory by default, but I had to email  help@xsede.org to request one!\n```/scratch/$USER/$PBS_JOBID``` (local flash disk, so orders of magnitude faster I/O than regular/network disk space; use for temporary files during the job runtime only; it's wiped off momentarily once the job finishes)\n```/oasis/project/nsf/cmu134/$USER/``` for data\n\n#### official documentation\n* old: https://www.xsede.org/web/guest/sdsc-trestles\n* new: http://www.sdsc.edu/us/resources/trestles/\n\n### stampede\n#### login:\n* create an account at https://portal.xsede.org/\n* send your username to Noah/Chris, they'll put in the request to add you\n* it takes at least 30 minutes to update a user information\n* ssh username@login.xsede.org\n* gsissh stampede\n\n#### available resources:\n* $HOME : 5G, backed-up\n* $WORK : 400G, not backed-up, permanent;

Due to licensing the collection is only accessible from CMU IP addresses. Go to http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/inner/LDC/LDC/table.html\n \nAngela Luck angieb@cs.cmu.edu is the official librarian for the collection. You should contact her for lending and other issues.\n \nLDC corpora were originally focused on the needs of the speech community, but over time have come to include materials of interest to the text, video and other communities. Until a few years ago acquisition was directly subsidized by the Speech Group (but available to all). More recently this role has been transferred to the LTI, which assesses ongoing contracts that use LDC corpora to meet the annual dues for our LDC membership (btw, we're a charter member!). The Speech Group continues to pay for the server on which the data are kept.\n \nThe collection is not complete. One reason is that in the early days, the LDC allowed members only a fixed number of corpora per year. We acquired only those that were relevant to ongoing projects. If you need one of the missing ones, you should be prepared to maybe contribute the cost from your project.\n \nBefore disk storage became cheap, we only had CDs of corpora. People borrowed these; not everyone turned them in. This is the other reason some corpora are missing. In many cases we have their name; it's in the square brackets at the entry of the entry description. Feel free to hunt them down or otherwise vocally bring this issue up in their presence. The end goal is to get the disc(s) back into the collection so that the data are available to all.\n \nWe have some other corpora in the collection. Most of these are in speech (since that's nominally my field). If you have corpora that might be of interest to other (believe me, they will be), please feel free to contributes copies to this collection.\n\n### other places to look for corpora already acquired\n* allegro:/usr0/corpora/\n* allegro:/usr1/corpora/\n* allegro:/mal1/corpora/\n* allegro:/mal2/corpora/ (largest collection)\n* allegro:/cab1/corpora/\n",
