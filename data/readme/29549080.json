All dependencies *should* get resolved upon install, though this has only been tested under the anaconda Python distribution, which has all the scientific stuff already well-organized.\n\nFor best results, it is also recommended to have ``MultiNest`` and ``pymultinest`` installed.  Without this, ``emcee`` will be used for stellar modeling, but the ``MulitNest`` results are a bit more trustworthy given the often multi-modal nature of stellar model fitting.\n\nBasic Usage\n-----------\n\nThe simplest way to run an FPP calculation straight out of the box is\nas follows.\n\n1. Make a text file containing the transit photometry in three columns: ``t_from_midtransit`` [days], ``flux`` [relative, where out-of-transit is normalized to unity], and ``flux_err``.  The file should not have a header row (no titles); and can be either whitespace or comma-delimited (will be ingested by ``np.loadtxt``).  \n\n2. Make a ``star.ini`` file that contains the observed properties of the target star (photometric and/or spectroscopic, whatever is available):: \n\n\t    #provide spectroscopic properties if available\n            #Teff = 3503, 80  #value, uncertainty\n            #feh = 0.09, 0.09\n            #logg = 4.89, 0.1\n\n\t    #observed magnitudes of target star\n\t    # If uncertainty provided, will be used to fit StarModel\n            J = 9.763, 0.03\n            H = 9.135, 0.03\n            K = 8.899, 0.02\n            Kepler = 12.473\n\n3. Make a ``fpp.ini`` file containing the following information::\n\n            name = k2oi #anything\n            ra = 11:30:14.510 #can be decimal form too\n            dec = +07:35:18.21\n\n            period = 32.988 #days\n            rprs = 0.0534   #Rp/Rstar best estimate\n            photfile = lc_k2oi.csv #contains transit photometry\n\n\t    [constraints]\n\t    maxrad = 12  # aperture radius [arcsec] \n\t    secthresh = 1e-4 # Maximum allowed depth of potential secondary eclipse \n\n4. Run the following from the command line (from within the same folder that has ``star.ini`` and ``fpp.ini``)::\n\n\t$  calcfpp \n\t \nOr, if you put the files in a folder called ``mycandidate``, then you can run ``calcfpp mycandidate``::\n\t \nThis will run the calculation for you, creating result files, diagnostic plots, etc.  \nIt should take 20-30 minutes.  If you want to do a shorter\nversion to test, you can try ``calcfpp -n 1000`` (the default is 20000).  The first\ntime you run it though, about half the time is doing the stellar modeling, so it will still\ntake a few minutes.\n\n\nAttribution\n-----------\n\nIf you use this code, please cite both the paper and the code.\n\nPaper citation::\n\n    @ARTICLE{2012ApJ...761....6M,\n    author = {{Morton}, T.~D.},\n    title = \"{An Efficient Automated Validation Procedure for Exoplanet Transit Candidates}\",\n    journal = {\\apj},\n    archivePrefix = \"arXiv\",\n    eprint = {1206.1568},\n    primaryClass = \"astro-ph.EP\",\n    keywords = {planetary systems, stars: statistics },\n    year = 2012,\n    month = dec,\n    volume = 761,\n    eid = {6},\n    pages = {6},\n    doi = {10.1088/0004-637X/761/1/6},\n    adsurl = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...761....6M},\n    adsnote = {Provided by the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System}\n    }\n\ncode::\n\n\t@MISC{2015ascl.soft03011M,\n\t   author = {{Morton}, T.~D.},\n\t    title = \"{VESPA: False positive probabilities calculator}\",\n\thowpublished = {Astrophysics Source Code Library},\n\t     year = 2015,\n\t    month = mar,\n\tarchivePrefix = \"ascl\",\n\t   eprint = {1503.011},\n\t   adsurl = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ascl.soft03011M},\n\t  adsnote = {Provided by the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System}\n\t}\n",
