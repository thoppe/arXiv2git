(c) \n\nSince the file system is also hierarchical as HDF5, the FITS data model can\nbe easily mapped to a file system hierarchy.\n\nHence fsfits is born:\n\n    python fits2fs.py inputfits  outputfsdir\n\n    import fsfits\n\n    with fsfits.FSHR.open('outputfsdir') as ff:\n        for key in ff:\n            hdu = ff[key]\n            print hdu.metadata\n            print hdu[...]\n\n\n(c) Note that this claim still has to be backed up by benchmarks.\n\n",
