The GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library (gmp and gmpxx)\n3. The GNU MPFR Library (mpfr)\n\nAlso C++ compiler supporting C++11 is necessary.\nInformation about program use available through --help option.\n\nABOUT \nThe program code based on results of http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.5236. It also implements \nthe version of Solovay Kitaev algorithm described in http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0505030. \nIn addition to Boost, The GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library, The GNU MPFR Library the library \nmpfr::real by Christian Schneider <software(at)chschneider(dot)eu> is used for high precision\nfloating point arithmetic. \n\nDIRECTORY STRUCTURE \nsk -- implementation of the Solovay-Kitaev algorithm\nes -- exact synthesis algorithm\ntheory -- numerical proof of result from arXiv:1206.5236, tests of exact synthesis algorithm \nappr -- optimal round off of unitaries",
