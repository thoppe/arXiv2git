  "README.rst": "orbitutils\n==========\nThis package allows for easy and very quick Monte Carlo simulation of populations of orbits, giving instantly distributions of projected separations, relative RVs between components, etc.  Includes calculations for eccentric orbits.  Handy for simulating imaging or RV observations.  This code is one of the modules that makes up the `Morton (2012) <http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012ApJ...761....6M>`_ validation procedure.\n\nMakes occasional use of the `astropy <www.astropy.org>`_ ``Quantity`` object to keep track of some quantities, and the astropy ``SkyCoord`` object to keep track of coordinates.  Also uses `pandas <pandas.pydata.org>`_ to save/restore populations.\n\n\nSee below for a quick intro, and the `notebook demo <http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/timothydmorton/orbitutils/blob/master/notebooks/demo.ipynb>`_ for more.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n::\n\n   $ pip install [--user] orbitutils\n   \nOr clone the repository and install::\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/timothydmorton/orbitutils.git\n    $ cd orbitutils\n    $ python setup.py install [--user]\n\nBasic usage\n-----------\n\nSimulate a population for given primary and secondary mass(es), and orbital periods.  Eccentricity is zero by default, but can be set.\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from orbitutils import OrbitPopulation\n    pop = OrbitPopulation(1,1,1000,n=1e4) #Primary mass, secondary mass, orbital period (d)\n\nYou can also create a distribution of secondary masses, and/or a distribution of periods:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import numpy as np\n    from orbitutils import OrbitPopulation\n    N=1e4\n    M2s = np.linspace(0.1,1,N)\n    Ps = np.logspace(1,3,N) #periods evenly log-spaced from 10 to 1000 days\n    pop = OrbitPopulation(1,M2s,Ps)\n\n``OrbitPopulation`` objects can be saved using the ``save_hdf`` method:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    pop.save_hdf('mypop.h5')\n\nand then read back in/restored as follows:\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    from orbitutils import OrbitPopulation_FromH5\n    pop_again = OrbitPopulation_FromH5('mypop.h5')\n\nAttribution\n-----------\nIf you use this software for your research, please let me know.
