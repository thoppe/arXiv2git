Louf and M. Barthelemy.\n\nIf you find this code useful in your research, please let me\nknow! **If you use a significant part of this code in a publication, please cite**\n\n```\nLouf, Remi, and Marc Barthelemy. \"Patterns of residential segregation.\" arXiv:1511.04268 (2015).\n```\n\n**Important note:** If you want to apply the methodology used in the paper rather\nthan simply reproduce the results, check out\n[Marble](https://github.com/scities/marble), a python library to analyse\nresidential segregation.\n\n\n## Use\n\nYou will need  *GNU Make*, *curl*, *git* and Python 2.7 installed on your machine (this should be\nthe case if your machine runs linux. Otherwise [Google](http://www.google.com)\nis your best friend). This was tested on Arch Linux and Python 2.7.9. Feel free\nto [start an issue](https://github.com/rlouf/socio-spatial-stratification/issues/new) if you cannot run the code.\n\n### Clone the repository\n\nIn command line, type\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/rlouf/socio-spatial-stratification your_folder_name\n```\n\nThis should download all the files and data necessary to *your_folder_name*.\n\n### Dependencies\n\n\nTo install the python libraries necessary to run the code, go to the cloned folder and type in command line\n\n```bash\npip install -r requirements.txt\n```\n\n### Run the analysis\n\nGo into the corresponding folder and type \n\n```bash\nmake\n```\nThe programme will prepare the data, perform the analysis and plot the figures in the folder 'figures'.\n\n## License and author\n\nThe code is distributed with a BSD license, see LICENSE.txt for more details.\n\n```\nCopyright (c) Scities\nRemi Louf <remi.louf@sciti.es>\n```\n",
