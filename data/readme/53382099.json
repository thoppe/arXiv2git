This is implementation of http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.00561v2.pdf (Except for the Upsampling layer where paper uses indices based upsampling which is not implemented in keras yet( *I am working on it*), but that shouldnt make a lot of difference). You can directly download the code from https://github.com/pradyu1993/segnet. This post is a explaination of what is happening in the code.\n\nhttp://pradyu1993.github.io/2016/03/08/segnet-post.html\n",
