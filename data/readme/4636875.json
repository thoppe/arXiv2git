Topics such as  the influence of the annual cycle, global warming, stochastic influences due to weather conditions and even off-equatorial heat-sinks can all be discussed using only modest analytical and numerical resources. Thus the DAO allows for a pedagogical introduction\nto the science of El Ni~no and La Ni~na while at the same time avoiding the need for large-scale computing resources normally associated with much more sophisticated coupled atmosphere-ocean general circulation models. It is an approach which is ideally suited for student projects both at high school and undergraduate level\".\n\n\nNotes\n------\n\n* It requires gnuplot installed.\n* It depends on [this project](https://github.com/mstn/MultivariateODESolvers).\n* It can be opened with Eclipse.\n\n\nReferences\n-----------\n\n[1] Ian Boutle, Richard H.
