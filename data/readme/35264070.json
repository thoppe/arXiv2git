Its main goal is the `development`_ of an open source network planning,\ndeployment, monitoring and maintanance platform with emphasis on community.\n\n.. _wlan slovenija: https://wlan-si.net\n.. _development: https://dev.wlan-si.net/wiki/Nodewatcher\n\nThis repository contains a paper presenting the project. The paper was published in\njournal `Computer Networks`_, in the `special issue on community networks`_,\n`DOI 10.1016/j.comnet.2015.09.021`_.\n\n.. _Computer Networks: http://www.journals.elsevier.com/computer-networks\n.. _special issue on community networks: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/journal/13891286/93/supp/P2\n.. _DOI 10.1016/j.comnet.2015.09.021: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2015.09.021\n\nAvailable at:\n\n* http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1389128615003400\n* https://www.sharelatex.com/github/repos/wlanslovenija/nodewatcher-paper/builds/latest/output.pdf\n* http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02372\n\nAbstract:\n\n    Community networks differ from regular networks by their organic growth patterns -- there is no central planning\n    body that would decide how the network is built. Instead, the network grows in a bottom-up fashion as more people\n    express interest in participating in the community and connect with their neighbors. People who participate in\n    community networks are usually volunteers with limited free time. Due to these factors, making the management of\n    community networks simpler and easier for all participants is the key component in boosting their growth.\n    Specifics of individual networks often force communities to develop their own sets of tools and best practices\n    which are hard to share and do not interoperate well with others. We propose a new general community network\n    management platform *nodewatcher* that is built around the core principle of modularity and extensibility, making\n    it suitable for reuse by different community networks. Devices are configured using a platform-independent\n    configuration which *nodewatcher* can transform into deployable firmware images, eliminating any manual device\n    configuration, reducing errors, and enabling participation of novice maintainers. An embedded monitoring system\n    enables live overview and validation of the whole community network. We show how the system successfully operates\n    in an actual community wireless network, *wlan slovenija*.\n\nYou can cite it as::\n\n    @article{Kos2015279,\n      title = \"nodewatcher: A substrate for growing your own community network\",\n      journal = \"Computer Networks\",\n      volume = \"93, Part 2\",\n      pages = \"279--296\",\n      year = \"2015\",\n      issn = \"1389-1286\",\n      doi = \"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.comnet.2015.09.021\",\n      author = \"Jernej Kos and Mitar Milutinovic and Luka Cehovin\",\n      keywords = \"Community networks\",\n      keywords = \"Management\",\n      keywords = \"Provisioning\",\n      keywords = \"Monitoring\",\n      keywords = \"Wireless\",\n      keywords = \"Mesh\"\n    }\n",
