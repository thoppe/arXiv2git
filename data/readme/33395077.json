These statistical methods are used for improving power in multiple testing via the use of prior information. The iGWAS method is provided for applications of p-value weighting in Genome-Wide Association Studies.\n\nSome of these methods were were developed by the authors in the following paper:\n*Optimal Multiple Testing Under a Gaussian Prior on the Effect Sizes* by Dobriban, Fortney, Kim, Owen:  http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.02935\n\n## An Example\nSuppose we want to find the significant effects in a large pool of candidates, by performing  multiple testing with the p-values `P_current`. We have some prior information about the size of each effect size in the form of prior test statistics `t1` with estimated variances `sigma`. The prior effects `t1` with standard errors `sigma` are our prior guesses for the current effects.\n\nTo use this information for improving power in multiple hypothesis testing, we can give each hypothesis a different weight. For instance, we can compute the Bayes p-value weights `w`, and use them to weight the current p-values `P_weighted` as follows: \n\n```{r}\nw <- bayes_weights(t1,sigma,q)$w\nP_weighted <- P_current/w\n```\n\nFinally, we perform weighted Bonferroni multiple testing, controlling the Family-Wise Error Rate, in the usual way: \n```{r}\nP_w_adjusted <- p.adjust(P_weighted,\"bonferroni\")\n```\n\nPlease see the vignette or the help files for examples and a description of the methods.\n\n## Installation instructions\n\nTo install from GitHub, make sure that Hadley Wickham's devtools (https://github.com/hadley/devtools) is installed, then run:\n\n```{r}\ndevtools::install_github(\"dobriban/pweight\")\n```\n\nThe package is also available from CRAN at:  https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/pweight/.\nTo install from CRAN within R, type\n\n```{r}\ninstall.packages(\"pweight\")\n```\n\n## Main components\n\nThe core of the package consists of the following p-value weighting methods, whose details are described in the documentation:\n\n* Spjotvoll weights: `spjotvoll_weights()` \n* Exponential weights: `exponential_weights()` \n* Bayes weights: `bayes_weights()`\n\nThe iGWAS method, `iGWAS()`, is provided for applications of p-value weighting in Genome-Wide Association Studies.\n\nPlease contact the authors if you have any questions. \n",
