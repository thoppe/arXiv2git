  "README.md": "# Temporal-Pooler-in-Matlab\nThis folder contains an implementation of the temporal pooler of a HTM network in MATLAB. It's a student project and just to understand the concepts of temporal pooling.\n\nPlease read the documentation in HTMinMATLAB.pdf for more informations.\nIn case of questions or suggestions please contact me on apwienvienna@gmail.com.\n\nFor a quick start copy all files in your Matlab folder and type the command \nHTM=mainTest( testNumber )\nwhere \"testNumber\" should be a number between 1 and 5.\n\nTo experiment with the network I recomend to change the settings for the network inside the mainTest() function.\nTo use your own data you can modify the data names in the mainTest() function. \n\nFor more detailed information on the concepts of temporal pooling and HTM networks, please check [1] and [2].\n\n[1] Jeff Hawkins, Subutai Ahmad. \"Why neurons have thousands of synapses, a theory of sequence memory in neocortex.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.00083 (2015).\n\n[2] Jeff Hawkins, Subutai Ahmad, Donna Dubinsky: HTM whitepaper, Numenta, September 2011, http://numenta.com/assets/pdf/whitepapers/hierarchical-temporal-memory-cortical-learning-algorithm-0.2.1-en.pdf\n",
