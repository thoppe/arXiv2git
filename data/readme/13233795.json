  "README": "* SurpriseMe - An integrated tool for network community structure\ncharacterization using Surprise maximization * \n----------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSurpriseMe is a free, open source software for detecting community structure\nin networks. The program uses Surprise to evaluate the outputs of 7 high-\nquality community detection algorithms. It also generates distance matrices\nthat allow to visualize the relationships among the solutions generated.\n\nYou can find more information here:\n\n  Aldecoa, R., & Marin, I.

If you use their solutions\nin your publications, please cite them appropriately:\n\nCPM: \"Narrow scope for resolution-limit-free community detection\"\n     Traag VA, Van Dooren P, Nesterov Y\n     Phys.

Links are assumed \nbidirectional, so that if id_1 id_2 is present in networkFile then \nid_2 id_1 should not be present. Some examples of this format can be\nseen in the net_examples folder.\n\n\nExample:\n./SurpriseMe net_examples/sample.pairs\n\n\n\nOutput files\n=============\n\nThe execution of the program creates the following files:\n\n- networkFile.S\t\t\tContains the value of Surprise for the \n\t\t\t\tsolution of each algorithm.\n\t\t\t\t\n- networkFile_algorithm.part\tPartition obtained by an algorithm.\n\t\t\t\tEach line contains the name of a node\n\t\t\t\tand its corresponding community\n\t\t\t\t\n- networkFile_VI.meg\t\tMEGA (www.megasoftware.net) input file.\n\t\t\t\tContains the distance matrix of all\n\t\t\t\tsolutions. Uses the Variation of\n\t\t\t\tInformation as a distance between partitions.\n\t\t\t\t\n- networkFile_1-NMI.meg\t\tMEGA (www.megasoftware.net) input file.\n\t\t\t\tContains the distance matrix of all\n\t\t\t\tsolutions. Uses (1 minus the Normalized\n\t\t\t\tMutual Information) as a distance between\n\t\t\t\tpartitions.\n\t\t\t\t\n\nHow to run only certain algorithms\n==================================\n\nYou can modify line 27 in SurpriseMe.pl in order to run only a few algorithms.\nBy default, the program runs all of them. Just remove from the array @algs\nthose you want to exclude from the analysis.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\nResources.
