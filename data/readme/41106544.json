That directory has its own `Makefile`.\n\nCached intermediate results are available at figshare:\n[`samplemixups_rcache.zip`](http://files.figshare.com/2219404/samplemixups_rcache.zip)\n(This contains a bunch of `.RData` files that go in `Analysis/R/Rcache`.)\n\n---\n\n## Necessary tools\n\n- [R](https://www.r-project.org)\n- Perl\n- Python 2.7\n- [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/)\n- [Asciidoc](http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/)\n- R packages: knitr, qtl, broman, lineup, ascii, data.table, igraph,\n  beeswarm, RColorBrewer\n\n---\n\n## To Do\n\n- Do clean tests, with and without the intermediate files\n",
