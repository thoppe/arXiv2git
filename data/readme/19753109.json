  "README.md": "METE-SSNT\n===========\n\nResearch project that compares models of the Maximum Entropy Theory of Ecology (METE) and of the size-structured neutral theory (SSNT), using forest survey data.\nThe project has been developed by Xiao Xiao, James P. O'Dwyer, and Ethan P. White.\nOur manuscript has been accepted by Ecology. \nA preprint is available on arXiv (http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.02767). \n\nCode in this repository replicates all analyses in the manuscript. \nA subset of the data sets included in our study can be obtained from our previous Dryad submission (http://datadryad.org/handle/10255/dryad.71012).\n\nSetup\n------------\nRequirements: Python 2.x, and the following Python modules: `numpy`, `scipy`, `matplotlib`, `mpl_tookits`, `mpmath`, `multiprocessing`, and `Cython`. \nIn addition, the following custom Python modules are also required: `METE` (https://github.com/weecology/METE),  and `macroecotools` (https://github.com/weecology/macroecotools).\nNote that you will have to navigate to /mete_distributions under module `METE` and run `setup.py` (from the command line: `python setup.py`) for Cython to properly compile.\n\nReplicate analyses\n------------------\nObtain sample data sets from http://datadryad.org/handle/10255/dryad.71012, and save them under the subdirectory /data/ in the working directory. \n\nSave the two scripts, `ssnt_mete_comparison.py` and `ssnt_mete_comp_analysis.py` under the working directory.\n\nAll analyses can be replicated by running the following command from the command line: \n\n`python ssnt_mete_comp_analysis.py`\n\nBy default, figures will be saved to the subdirectory /out\\_figs/. \nIntermediate output files will be saved to the subdirectory /out\\_files/. \n",
