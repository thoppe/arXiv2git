  "README.md": "#Major update\n\n__NOTE__: These scripts are irrelevant now, as we've had issues with serving up FASTQ files from our campus cluster.\n\nYou therefore have two choices:\n\n* Download our BAM files from the SRA using the accession numbers in the MBE paper.  If you need the FASTQ files, you can reconstruct them from the BAM files.\n* Download the data via Google Drive, which will be quite slow: [Link](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0Bxy-54SBqeekakFpeFBib3BXcVE&usp=sharing)\n\nThe latter option could be quite slow...\n\n#Old README content\nShell scripts to download data from Rogers et al. Landscape of standing variation for tandem duplications in *Drosophila yakuba* and *Drosophila simulans*.\n\nThese citation for these data is:\n\nRogers, R. L., J. M. Cridland, L. Shao, T. Hu, P. Andolfatto and K. R. Thornton (accepted, Molecular Biology and Evolution) Landscape of standing variation for tandem duplications in Drosophila yakuba and Drosophila simulans.\n\nA preprint of the paper is on [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.7371).\n\n",
