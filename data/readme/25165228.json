  "README.md": "Quantum dots in two dimensions and the \"strictly correlated electrons\" (SCE) framework\n======================================================================================\n\nC source code (with minor improvements) and Mathematica demonstration file `quantum_dot_demo.nb` for the calculations in Ref. 1: Kohn-Sham density functional theory using the \"strictly correlated electrons\" (SCE) functional applied to quantum dots in two dimensions. The program uses the Mathematica MathLink interface and requires a BLAS/LAPACK library, for example AMD's Core Math Library (ACML), as well as the GNU Scientific Library (GSL).\n\nHow to compile the source code:\n* Windows: Visual Studio 2013 project files are provided in the *vcproj_mlink* subfolder\n* Linux: a makefile is available in the *mlink* subfolder. You probably have to adapt paths and the BLAS/LAPACK function calls to your local installation\n\n\nLicense\n-------\nCopyright (c) 2013-2014, Christian B.
