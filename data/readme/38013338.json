See [http://www.carlboettiger.info/2013/04/23/we-need-more-object-oriented-design-in-comparative-methods.html](http://www.carlboettiger.info/2013/04/23/we-need-more-object-oriented-design-in-comparative-methods.html)\n\n* Author: Carl Boettiger\n* License: [CC0](http://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/)\n\nThis package accompanies my publication, with Graham Coop & Peter Ralph (2012) **Is your phylogeny \nInformative? Measuring the power of comparative methods**. In *Evolution*.\n([doi](http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2012.01574.x)) \n([pdf](http://www.mendeley.com/download/public/98752/4485545653/9a209c7dd29980fd2e47c06eb8b2d1d7dd6f70d4/dl.pdf))\n([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.4944))\n([code](https://github.com/cboettig/pmc))\n([data](http://datadryad.org/handle/10255/dryad.37645))\n\n\n\n## Install\n\nThe easiest way to install the current release is through the CRAN repository, \n\n```r\ninstall.packages(\"pmc\")\n```\n\nTo install the current development version, there are a few options.  One is to install `devtools` package, which will let you install directly from github:\n\n```r\ninstall.packages(\"devtools\")\nlibrary(devtools)\ninstall_github(\"pmc\", \"cboettig\")\n```\n\nThe other option is to download the current tarball, put it in the working directory, and then install from R using\n```r\ninstall.packages(\"pmc*.tar.gz\", ,type=\"source\", repos=NULL)\n```\n\n## Getting Started\nThe best place to start learning the package commands is to read the [package vignette](https://github.com/cboettig/pmc/blob/master/vignettes/pmc_tutorial.pdf), copy-pasting the examples in as you go.  For a faster start, just look at the examples in the function documentation, i.e. `?pmc`.  \n\n## Bug Reports\nIf you find the package is giving unexpected results, is missing a feature you'd like, or have any other questions about the package, don't hesitate to email me. \n\nYou can also [file an issue](https://github.com/cboettig/pmc/issues) which will provide a record of the bug/request.  Posting an issue also automatically sends me an email.  \n\n\n\n\n\n",
