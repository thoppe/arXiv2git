  "README.md": "# Structurally Constrained Recurrent Neural Network\n\nThis is a self contained software accompanying the paper titled: Learning\nLonger Memory in Recurrent Neural Networks: http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7753.\nThe code allows you to reproduce our results on two language modeling datasets:\n* PenntreeBank\n* Text8\n\nThe code implements three recurrent models:\n* Standard Recurrent Neural Networks\n* Long Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Networks\n* Structurally Constrained Recurrent Neural Networks\n\nIt also allows you to play around with various hyper-parameters.\n\n## Examples\nHere are some of the examples of how to use the code.\n\n* To run a standard RNN model on PenntreeBank with following\nhyper-parameters:\n  * hidden units: 100\n  * minibatch size: 32\n  * learning rate: 0.05\n\nyou type\n```\nth -i main.lua -dset ptb -name srnn_sm -nhid 100 -batchsz 32 -eta 0.05\n```\n\n* To run a LSTM RNN model on Text8 with following\nhyper-parameters:\n  * hidden units: 100\n  * minibatch size: 32\n  * learning rate: 0.05\n  * unfolding depth: 20\n  * backprop frequency: 5\n\nyou type\n```\nth -i main.lua -dset text8 -name lstm_sm -nhid 100 -batchsz 32 -eta 0.05 -blen 20 -bfreq 5\n```\n\n* To run a Structurally Constrained RNN model on PenntreeBank with following\nhyper-parameters:\n  * hidden units: 100\n  * number of constrained units: 20\n  * minibatch size: 32\n  * learning rate: 0.05\n  * unfolding depth: 30\n  * backprop frequency: 5\n\nyou type\n```\nth -i main.lua -dset text8 -name scrnn_sm -nhid 100 -nslow 20 -batchsz 32 -eta 0.05 -blen 30 -bfreq 5\n```\n\nTo list all the options available, you need to type\n```\nth main.lua --help\n```\n\n\n## Requirements\nThe software requires you to have the following two packages already\ninstalled on your systems:\n* Torch 7\n* fbcunn\n* Installation instructions for both on Ubuntu 14.04 are here: https://github.com/facebook/fbcunn/blob/master/INSTALL.md\n\n\n## Installing\nDownload the files in an appropriate directory and run\nthe code from there. See below.\n\n\n## How Structurally Constrained Recurrent Neural Network Software works\nThe top level file is called main.lua. In order to run the code\nyou need to run the file using torch. For example:\n```\nth -i main.lua -<option1_name> option1_val -<option2_name> option2_val ...\n```\n\nIn order to check what all options are available, type\n```\nth -i main.lua --help\n```\n\n## License\nStructurally Constrained Recurrent Neural Network is BSD-licensed.\nWe also provide an additional patent grant.\n\n\n## Other Details\nSee the CONTRIBUTING file for how to help out.\n",
