In comparison to the algorithm of Karger et al., jump consistent hash requires no storage, is  faster, and does a better job of evenly dividing the key space among the buckets and of evenly dividing the workload  when the number of buckets changes. Its main limitation is that the buckets must be numbered sequentially, which  makes it more suitable for data storage applications than for distributed web caching.\n\nUses Guava library for unsigned longs.\n\nUsage\n=====\n\n    int bucket = JumpHash.consistent(nrOfBuckets, myObject);\n\nDownload\n========\n\nAvailable on [Maven central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cjumphash):\n\n - com.streametry:jumphash:1.0\n\nRequires Java 1.8\n    \nBuild\n=====\n\n    gradle jar\n    \n\nLicense\n=======\n\nMIT\n",
