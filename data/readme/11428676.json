This package is not present on CRAN. Hence, some manual installation may be necessary. The following command:\n\n```{r}\ninstall.packages(\"Sxslt\", repos = \"http://www.omegahat.org/R\", type = \"source\")\n```\nshould do the trick. If it doesn't, try:\n\n```{r}\ndevtools::install_github(\"cboettig/Sxslt\")\n```\nNext, installing **openWAR** is best accomplished through the *install_github()* function in the **devtools** package. \n\n```{r}\ndevtools::install_github(\"beanumber/openWAR\")\n```\n\n#### Data Source\n\nThe *gameday()* function downloads play-by-play data from the GameDay server hosted by Major League Baseball Advanced Media. This data is not *libre*, but it lives on a publicly-available webserver. \n\nGetting individual game data is as simple as:\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(openWAR)\ngd <- gameday()\nsummary(gd)\n```\n\nTo retrieve a data.frame of many games worth, try:\n\n```{r}\nds <- getData()\n```\n\nThis will retrieve play-by-play data for all games played yesterday (by default). For each play, 62 variables are recorded. \n\n#### Methodology\n\nPlease see our full paper on the [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.7158) or in the forthcoming issue of the *Journal of Quantitative Analysis in Sports*. \n",
