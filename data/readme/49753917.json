  "README.md": "# PoseNet\n**This is a modified version of [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe) which supports the [PoseNet architecture](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/projects/relocalisation/)**\n\nAs described in the ICCV 2015 paper **PoseNet: A Convolutional Network for Real-Time 6-DOF Camera Relocalization** Alex Kendall, Matthew Grimes and Roberto Cipolla [http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/projects/relocalisation/]\n\n## Getting Started\n\n * Download the Cambridge Landmarks dataset [from here.](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/projects/relocalisation/)\n * Download models and trained weights [from here.](http://mi.eng.cam.ac.uk/~agk34/resources/PoseNet.zip)\n\nCreate an LMDB localisation dataset with ```caffe-posenet/posenet/scripts/create_posenet_lmdb_dataset.py``` Change lines 1, 11 & 12 to the appropriate directories.\n\nTest PoseNet with ```caffe-posenet/posenet/scripts/test_posenet.py``` using the command ```python test_posenet.py --model your_model.prototxt --weights your_weights.caffemodel --iter size_of_dataset```\n\n## Publications\n\nIf you use this software in your research, please cite our publications:\n\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07427\nAlex Kendall, Matthew Grimes and Roberto Cipolla \"PoseNet: A Convolutional Network for Real-Time 6-DOF Camera Relocalization.\" Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision (ICCV), 2015. \n\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1509.05909\nAlex Kendall and Roberto Cipolla \"Modelling Uncertainty in Deep Learning for Camera Relocalization.\" The International Conference on Robotics and Automation, 2015. \n\n\n## License\n\nThis extension to the Caffe library and the PoseNet models are released under a creative commons license which allows for personal and research use only.
