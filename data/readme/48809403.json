It includes rm (a reactive memory manager), dc2 (a library for managing dataflow constraints), as well as various test programs and benchmarks.\n\nDC includes portions of the Leonardo Library [http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/~leonardo/ll.shtml].\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nDOCUMENTATION\n\nDC is presented and extensively discussed in the following conference paper:\n\n* C. Demetrescu, I. Finocchi and A. Ribichini: \"Reactive Imperative Programming with Dataflow Constraints\", in Proceedings of the 26th ACM International Conference on Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages and Applications (OOPSLA 2011), pp. 407-426, recipient of an OOPSLA Distinguished Paper award, 2011 [http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2048100]\n\nand in the following technical report:\n\n* C. Demetrescu, I. Finocchi and A. Ribichini: \"Reactive Imperative Programming with Dataflow Constraints\", arXiv:1104.2293 [cs.PL], 2011 [http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.2293].\n\nA detailed API reference can be found at the following url: [http://www.dis.uniroma1.it/~demetres/dc/].\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nLICENSE\n\nDC is distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public License, Version 2.1, February 1999.

Please see included file ./ll-core/LICENSE.txt.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nPLATFORM DETAILS\n\nDC has been designed to run on IA-32 Linux platforms. \n\nDC requires the following libraries: glib-2.0, libelf, libdisasm. \n\nDC has been tested on Linux Mandriva 2010.1 with gcc 4.4.3 and Qt 4.6.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------\nQUICK START\n\n1) Running 'make' from ./rm/ should create the rm library.\n\n2) Running 'make' from ./dc2/ should create the dc library.\n\n3) Various benchmarks and test programs can be compiled and launched through the makefiles in ./rm/test/, ./dc2/examples/, ./dc2/test/debug/, ./dc2/test/perf/.\n\n4) To compile test programs that use the Qt library (e.g., those in subfolders of ./dc2/test/qt/), Qt's command 'qmake' should be used, in order to generate the actual makefiles, before executing 'make'.\n\n",
