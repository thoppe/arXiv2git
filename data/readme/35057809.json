Werner.\n\nsee http://arxiv.org/abs/1107.0104\n\nThe function tvb.m uses vert2lcon.m created by Matt J. http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/30892-representing-polyhedral-convex-hulls-by-vertices-or--in-equalities/content/vert2lcon.m\n\n\"distinguishable_colors.m\" picks colors that are maximally perceptually distinct. The function is written by Timothy E. Holy.\n",
