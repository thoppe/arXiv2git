Feel free to clone this repository\nand issue a pull request, or send things to rjl at uw.edu for inclusion.\n\n### General Guides\n\n* [Software Sustainability Institute](http://software.ac.uk/so-exactly-what-software-did-you-use) \n     ...

(But note that arXiv insisted \n  that the papers announcing 8.0 and 8.1 were two versions of the same paper,\n  rather than two distinct papers as was desired.)\n\n### Publishing venues in other fields\n\n* [Journal of Statistical Software](http://www.jstatsoft.org/)\n* [The Stata Journal](http://www.stata-journal.com/)\n* Examples of journal papers announcing releases:\n  * [Second Data release of Sloan Digital Sky Survey](http://iopscience.iop.org/1538-3881/128/1/502/pdf/1538-3881_128_1_502.pdf)\n  * [Sixth Data release of Sloan Digital Sky Survey](http://iopscience.iop.org/0067-0049/175/2/297/pdf/0067-0049_175_2_297.pdf)\n  * [The ALPS Project release 2.0](http://iopscience.iop.org/1742-5468/2011/05/P05001) -- [arXiv version](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1101.2646.pdf)\n\n### Other relevant links\n\n* [NSF Dear Colleague letter on data/software citation](http://www.nsf.gov/pubs/2014/nsf14059/nsf14059.jsp)\n",
