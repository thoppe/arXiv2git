  "README.md": "This is the codebase for computing effective information (ei), the minimum information partition (MIP), integrated information (phi), and other measures related to the _Information Integration Theory_ of Consciousness (IITC).  This is code underlying my [http://thesis.library.caltech.edu/8041/](PhD thesis).  It computes [psi measure](http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.0978) and is *by far* the fastest implementation of [Balduzzi-Tononi-2008 phi](http://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000091).  The major restrictions about the code are:\n\n* It only works for networks of DETERMINISTIC, BINARY nodes.\n* It only works for networks with <= 32 nodes.\n\n--------\n\n# Popular Reading\n1.

If on a mac, you can install these using 'macports' or 'homebrew'.\n\n\n## Compiling\nRun the command 'recompile', which generates an executable 'consciousness'.  I.e.,\n\n   $ ./recompile\n   $ ./consciousness filename.txt\n\nComputes the measures for the system specified in filename.txt\n\n### Notes\nThe directory \"e/\" contains example systems to compute the phi/psi.  For example, to compute the measures for the system \"transitions/3RN.txt\", you'd do:\n\n   $ ./consciousness e/transitions/3RN.txt\n\nThe directory 'balduzzi_python' contains the original python code from David Balduzzi to compute the phi in the 2008 paper, \"Integrated Information in Discrete Dynamical Systems\".  The directory 'tests' is a series of simple programs that spit out system diagnostic information.  It's unlikely you'll ever need them.  You can safely ignore this directory.\n",
