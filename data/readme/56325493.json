The syntax is \r\n\r\n  err=WGElliptic(n,d0,db,dnw);\r\n\r\nThe input arguments:\r\n\r\n n is the mesh grid parameter\r\n   The domain is [0,1]*[0,1] with uniform triangle partition,\r\n   and the length of right angle side is set to be 1/n.\r\n d0 is the degree of u_0, i.e. u_0\\in P_{d0}(T)\r\n   d0 should be an integer, and 1<=d0<=5.\r\n db is the degree of u_b, i.e. u_b\\in P_{db}(e)\r\n   db should be an integer, and 1<=db<=5.\r\n dnw is the degree of weak gradient, i.e. \\nabla_w v\\in [P_{dnw}(T)]^2\r\n   dnw should be an integer, and 0<=dnw<=5.\r\n\r\nThe output arguments:\r\n\r\n err is a 1*2 vector containing the triple-bar norm (which is equivalent to H^1 norm) and the L^2 norm of the error.\r\n\r\nMoreover, if a figure for numerical solution is necessary, please set the variable draw=1 in presetting.m. The Dirichlet boundary condition and the source term can also be alternated in presetting.m. The detailed description can be found in presetting.m.\r\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\r\n\r\nAlgorithm introduction:\r\n\r\nIn this program, we consider a uniform triangle mesh for the unit square domain [0,1]*[0,1]. The descripitions about partition can be found in partition.m.\r\n\r\nDenote T_h the triangle partition. T is the element in T_h, and e is the edge in T_h. For each element T, denote h_T its diameter.\r\n\r\nNow, we introduce the weak Galerkin method for Laplacian problem briefly. First, define the following weak functions space \r\n\r\nV_h=\\{ v=(v_0,v_b);v_0\\in P_k(T), v_b\\in P_j(e)\\},\r\n\r\nV_h=\\{ v=(v_0,v_b);v_0\\in P_k(T), v_b\\in P_j(e), v_b=0 on \\partial\\Omega\\},\r\n\r\nwhere j,k are given non-negative integers.\r\n\r\nDefine a vector valued function space G=[P_l(T)]^2, where l is an integer. Define the weak gradient operator \\nabla_w: V_h->G by the following equation.\r\nSuppose v\\in V_h, for any \\phi\\in G, define \\nabla_w v\\in G, such that on each element T\\in T_h\r\n\r\n(\\nabla_w v,\\phi)_T = -(v_0,\\nabla\\cdot\\phi)_T+( v_b,\\phi\\cdot n)_\\partial T,\r\n\r\nwhere (\\cdot,\\cdot) denotes the L^2 inner-product.\r\n\r\nWe also need to define the L^2 projection operator Q_m on each edge e. Denote m=max{j,l}, and on each edge e, Q_m is L^2 projection from L^2(e) onto P_m(e).\r\n\r\nNow, define the following two bilinear forms:\r\n\r\nFor any v,w\\in V_h,\r\n\r\n    s(v,w)=\\sum_{T\\in T_h} h_T^{-1} (Q_m v_0-v_b, Q_m w_0-w_b)_\\partial T,\r\n\r\n    a(v,w)=\\sum_{T\\in T_h} (\\nabla_w v,\\nabla_w w)+s(v,w).\r\n\r\nThe weak Galerkin algorithm for Laplacian problem is:\r\n\r\nFind u_h\\in V_h, such that u_h=Q_j g on \\partial\\Omega, and for any v\\in V_h, \r\n\r\n    a(u_h,v)=(f,v_0).\r\n\r\nIf there is any questions regarding the code, please contact:\r\nQilong Zhai, \r\nRuishu Wang,\r\nLin Mu, mul1@ornl.gov\r\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\r\n\r\nHow to cite this code:\r\n\r\nZhai, Q, Wang, R, and Mu, L.
