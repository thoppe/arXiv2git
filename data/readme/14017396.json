If you find this useful in your research, please cite the publication listed below. \n\nFor details on how DCSIMSEP works, see:\n* Margaret J. Eppstein and Paul D. H. Hines. A \"Random Chemistry\" Algorithm for Identifying Collections of Multiple Contingencies that Initiate Cascading Failure. IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, vol. 27, no. 3, 2012.\n* Pooya Rezaei, Paul Hines and Margaret Eppstein, Estimating Cascading Failure Risk with Random Chemistry, IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, vol. 30, no. 5, 2015. <http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.4213>\n\nTo get started with DCSIMSEP do the following:\n\n1. Navigate to the dcsimsep folder from within MATLAB\n2. Edit and run the setup.m script (this just sets up the paths)\n3. Navigate to the test/ directory: ``cd test''\n3. Edit and run test_dcsimsep.m to run some tests.  \n",
