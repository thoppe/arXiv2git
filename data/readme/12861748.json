Dahlin and F. Lindsten, Particle filter-based Gaussian Process Optimisation for Parameter Inference. Proceedings of the 18th World Congress of the International Federation of Automatic Control (IFAC), Cape Town, South Africa, August 2014. *\n\nA pre-print of the paper is found at < http://arxiv.org/abs/1311.0689 >.\n\nRequirements\n--------------\nThe program is written in Matlab 2013a and uses the GPML toolbox for the Gaussian process modelling. The GMPL toolbox is available for download from http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/code/matlab/doc/. The program also requires a DIRECT optimisation algorithm, available for download at < http://www4.ncsu.edu/~ctk/Finkel_Direct/ >.\n\n\nIncluded files\n--------------\n\n**RUNME**\nExecutes the Matlab program that reproduces the plot in the paper for the Stochastic volaility model.\n\n**pf**\nRuns a bootstrap particle filter with systematic resampling to estimate the log-likelihood.\n\n**datagen**\nGenerates data from a general state space model given function handles and the input.\n\n**evalMu** \nEvaluates the posterior mean for the Gaussian processes (used by Direct)\n\n**EI** \nEvaluates the expected improvment by using the Gaussian processes (used by Direct)\n",
