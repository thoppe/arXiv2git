  "README.md": "# gSLICr: SLIC superpixels at over 250Hz\n\n![sample](sample.bmp)\n\nThis is the software bundle \"gSLICr\", a library for real-time superpixel segmentation written in C++ and CUDA. The current version is maintained by:\n\n  [Carl Yuheng Ren](http://www.carlyuheng.com/) : <carl@robots.ox.ac.uk>  \n  [Victor Adrian Prisacariu](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~victor/) : <victor@robots.ox.ac.uk>  \n  Ian D Reid : <ian.reid@adelaide.edu.au>  \n\nFor more information about gSLICr please visit the project website <http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~victor/gslicr>. \n\nOther related projects can be found in the Oxford Active Vision Library <http://www.oxvisionlib.org>.\n\n#1. Updates from gSLIC\n- Works for any size / number of super pixels\n- With GTX Titan X, 3.4ms@640x480, 12ms@1280x960, 20ms@1920x1080 image\n- Multi-platform supported\n  - Win8 Visual Studio\n  - Ubuntu 14.04\n  - Mac OSX 10.10\n\n#2. Building the System\n\n###2.1 Requirements\n\nSeveral 3rd party libraries are needed for compiling gSLICr. The given version numbers are checked and working, but different versions might be fine as well. Some of the libraries are optional, and skipping them will reduce functionality.\n\n  - cmake (e.g. version 2.8.10.2 or 3.2.3)  \n    REQUIRED for Windows and Linux, unless you write your own build system  \n    available at http://www.cmake.org/\n\n  - CUDA (e.g. version 6.0 or 7.0)  \n    REQUIRED for all GPU accelerated code  \n    available at https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads\n\n  - OpenCV (e.g. version 3.0)  \n    REQUIRED if you want to run the demo, where it is used for reading camera input and displaying UI\n    available at http://opencv.org/downloads.html\n\n###2.2 Build Process\n\n  To compile the system, use the standard cmake approach:\n```\n  $ mkdir build\n  $ cd build\n  $ cmake /path/to/gSLICr\n  $ make\n```\n\n  To run demo:\n- plug in a webcam\n- use the standard cmake approach:\n```\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake ../\nmake\n./demo\n```\n- press `s` to save current segmentation result to current folder.\n\n#3.
