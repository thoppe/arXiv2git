Ward, 2014, \"Ensemble Forecasting of Irregular Regime Change,\" Research & Politics.\n\n```bibtex\n@article{beger2014ensemble,\n  title={Ensemble Forecasting of Irregular Leadership Changes},\n  author={Beger, Andreas, Dorff, Cassy L., Ward, Michael D.},\n  journal={Research \\& Politics},\n  year={2014},\n  volume={1},\n  issue={3},\n  pages={1-7}\n}    \n```\n\nGetting the code and data\n-----\n\nThe easiest way to get the replication code is to [download a zip](https://github.com/andybega/rap-ensemble-forecasting/archive/master.zip). Alternatively, you can clone the repository through the Github GUI client ([OS X](https://mac.github.com/), [Windows](https://windows.github.com/)).\n\nThe data, including several intermediate results, are available on dataverse: [http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/27482](http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/27482).\n\n\nRunning the replication\n-----\n\n1. [Download](https://github.com/andybega/rap-ensemble-forecasting/archive/master.zip) or [clone](github-mac://openRepo/https://github.com/andybega/rap-ensemble-forecasting) this repository. \n\n2. Download the 3 data sets on [Dataverse](http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/27482) and place them in `replication/data`.\n\n3. In `runme.R`, change the working directory path on line 33.\n\n4. Source or run the code in `runme.R`. We recommend running through the code block by block rather than sourcing. The original analysis was run on OS X using R 3.0.2 and 3.1.1.\n\nThe script relies on two packages, `EBMAforecastbeta` and `spduration` that are not available on CRAN. They are included in `replication/R/packages` with both OS X and Windows versions. The replication script will attempt to install them if they are not already present, but you may have to do so manually if this fails.\n\nSee `replication.pdf` for a list of included files and scripts.",
