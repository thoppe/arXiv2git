Clone TensorFlow (v0.8) into the root folder of this project.\n  You can find a link to the github repo at https://www.tensorflow.org/. Follow the instructions to\n  build and install it. You should build from source because we use a custom user op implemented\n  in C++.\n\n  2. In the folder `rotate_op/` you will find three files: `BUILD`, `rotate.cc` and `rotate_grad.cc`.\n  These are user operations that we wrote. Copy them into `tensorflow/tensorflow/core/user_ops`.\n  Then run the following command `bazel build -c opt //tensorflow/core/user_ops:rotate.so` in that directory.\n  This generates the `.so` file that will be loaded by `ntm.py`. If you did not clone tensorflow\n  into the root folder of this project as instructed, please modify the path in `ntm.py` accordingly.\n  \n  3. To execute the copy task, run `python copy_task.py`.\n  \n## Checkpoints\n\nCheckpoint files are automatically saved by `copy_task.py` every 1000 training iterations.\nYou can reload a saved model and run it with custom inputs using `analyze.py`.\nYou might have to make some changes specific to your experiment.\n\n## Report\n\nYou will find the accompanying final report in the `report/` folder. It uses some images from the\n`images/` folder. Print statements along with `parse.py` were used to log\nsome of the internal state of the NTM, like the read and write head positions that we show in the\nreport.\n\n## Code Structure\n\nYou will find all the NTM specific code in `ntm.py`. The boilerplate/experiment-harness code for\nthe copy task can be found in `copy_task.py`. Files prefixed with `test_` are small test scripts.\nMost of them just check if the code runs without crashing. The experiment code\nfor the context-free parenthesis language experiment can be found in `dyck_task.py`.\nUnfortunately due to lack of time we were unable to write it up.\n\n## Resources:\n\nhttps://www.tensorflow.org/\n\nhttps://medium.com/snips-ai/ntm-lasagne-a-library-for-neural-turing-machines-in-lasagne-2cdce6837315#.17cngz3vj\n\nhttp://awawfumin.blogspot.com/2015/03/neural-turing-machines-implementation.html\n\nhttps://blog.wtf.sg/2015/01/15/neural-turing-machines-faq/#more-843\n",
