  "README.md": "# Worldline-Flux-Tube-Lattice\nC and CUDA code for computing the effective actions of cylindrically symmetric magnetic field configurations using worldline numerics parallelized on Nvidia GPUs.\n\n## Documentation:\nThe most detailed documentation for this code is provided in my PhD thesis:\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1209.4409\n\nNote that this code is functional, but not mature. It was developed primarily in 2011 as part of a physics PhD project. The following important improvements are still outstanding:\n- Use of CUDA memory heirarchy should be improved. The worldline data did not fit into shared memory on the target devices, but on newer devices this should not be a problem. Occupancy can likely be improved by moving numerical constants from registers into constant memory.\n- Asynchronous CPU and GPU computing and memory transfers can be improved.\n- CPU-side integrations can be improved by using optimized third-party libraries. There may also be optimized integration libraries suitable for use in the GPU kernels.\n\n## Installation:\nThe code uses few dependencies. There is a basic Makefile that has worked on at least two different Linux systems. \n\n## Citations:\nCasimir interactions between magnetic flux tubes in a dense lattice\n\nDan Mazur and Jeremy S.
