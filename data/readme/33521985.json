For convenience, they are included in the folder: \n\n`./libs` and pre-compiled in Linux. These toolboxes are as follows:\n\n1. MatConvNet is required for the CNN training, which can be downloaded at: http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/\n\n2. VLFeat is required for generating superpixels, which is available at http://www.vlfeat.org/.\nThis code is tested using the VLFeat 0.9.18 version.\n\n\n\n# Run \n\n1. Users need to compile MatConvNet before running our code. \nPlease refer to: http://www.vlfeat.org/matconvnet/\n\n2. We provide a demo file in folder `./demo/`: \n \n     `demo_DCNF_FCSP_depths_prediction.m`\n     \n\t This is a demo for predicting depths of given images using our trained model. \n\n3. We provide two trained models (trained using the Make3D and NYUD2 datasets respectively) in the folder `./model_trained`. \n\n\n\n\n# Contact\n\nauthors: Fayao Liu, Chunhua Shen, Guosheng Lin, Ian Reid (University of Adelaide, Australia)\n\nemail: firstname.lastname@adelaide.edu.au\n\n\n# Copyright\n\nCopyright (c) The authors, 2015.\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
