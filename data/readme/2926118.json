  "README": "knotkit is a C++ software package written by Cotton Seed\n(cseed@math.princeton.edu) for computing some knot and manifold\ninvariants appearing in low-dimensional topology.  Other contributors\ninclude Josh Batson.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n\n1. INTRO\n2. BUILDING\n3. USAGE\n4. UPCOMING CHANGES\n5. FOR DEVELOPERS\n\n1. INTRO\n\nIn addition to accepting knot presentations in a variety of formats\n(see usage below), knotkit contains the following tables of knot data:\n\n* The Rolfsen knot tables through 10 crossings, extracted from\n  Bar-Natan's Mathematica package, KnotTheory`,\n* The Hoste-Weeks-Thistlewaite knot tables through 16 crossings taken\n  from knotscape, and\n* and the Morwen Thistlewaite hyperbolic link tables taken from\n  SnapPy.\n\nThis version of knotkit has support to compute the following\ninvariants:\n\n* Khovanov homology\nSee:\nM. Khovanov, A Categorification of the Jones Polynomial, Duke\n  Math. J. 101 (2000), 359--426, arXiv:math/9908171.\nD. Bar-Natan, On Khovanov's Categorification of the Jones Polynomial,\n  Algebraic and Geometric Topology 2 (2002), 337--370.\n\n* Szabo's geometric spectral sequence \nComputing gss was the original motivation for writing knotkit.  For\nmore information on gss, see:\nZ. Szabo, A geometric spectral sequence in Khovanov homology, \n  arXiv:1010.4252, and\nC. Seed, Computations of Szabo's Geometric Spectral Sequence in Khovanov\n  Homology, arXiv:1110.0735.\n\n* The Batson-Seed link splitting spectral sequence\nSee:\nJ. Batson, C. Seed, A Link Splitting Spectral Sequence in Khovanov\n  Homology.\n\n* The Lipshitz-Sarkar Steenrod square on Khovanov homology\nSee:\nR. Lipshitz, S. Sarkar, A Khovanov Homotopy Type, arXiv:1112.3932.\nR. Lipshitz, S. Sarkar, A Steenrod Square on Khovanov Homology,\n  arXiv:1204.5776.\n\n* Bar-Natan's analogue of Lee homology\nSee:\nE. S. Lee, An endomorphism of the Khovanov invariant, Adv. Math. 197\n  (2005), 2, 554-586, arXiv:math/0210213.\nD. Bar-Natan, Khovanov's homology for tangles and cobordisms,\n  Geom.

Rasmussen, Khovanov homology and the slice genus, Invent.\n  Math. 182 2 (2010), 419--447, arXiv:math/0402131.\nR. Lipshitz, S. Sarkar, A refinement of Rasmussen's s-invariant,\n  arXiv:1206.3532.\n\n2. BUILDING\n\nTo build knotkit on OS X, you will need the latest version of XCode\n(available for free in the App Store) and the GNU multiple precision\narithmetic library (GMP).  You can get GMP here:\n\nhttp://gmplib.org/\n\nknotkit also builds under Linux.  In addition to GMP, you will need a\nC++ compiler which supports C++11.  I use LLVM clang, but knotkit\nshould build with a recent version of GCC.\n\nknotkit doesn't have a sophisticated build system.  To build knotkit,\njust run:\n\nmake\n\nfrom the knotkit source directory.  This should build the executable\n\"kk\".  For instructions on invoking kk, see usage below.  If you run\ninto a problem, please contact me: Cotton Seed\n(cotton@math.princeton.edu).\n\n3. USAGE\n\nThe usage message for kk is given below.  This can also be obtained by\nrunning \"kk -h\".\n\nA note about output.  The output for commands kh, gss, ls and lee is a\n.tex file which renders the bigraded homology group or spectral\nsequence.  The output for the command sq2 matches the output for the\nprogram written by Lipshitz-Sarkar and is suitable for loading into\nSage.  The command s outputs a single line of text.\n\nusage: kk <invariant> [options...] <link>\n  compute <invariant> for knot or link <link>\n<invariant> can be one of:\n  kh: Khovanov homology\n  gss: Szabo's geometric spectral sequence\n  lsss: Batson-Seed link splitting spectral sequence\n    component weights are 0, 1, ..., m\n  sq2: Lipshitz-Sarkar Steenrod square on Z/2 Kh\n    output suitable for Sage\n  leess: spectral sequence coming from Bar-Natan analogue of Lee's\n    deformation of Khovanov's complex (whew!)\n  s: Rasmussen's s-invariant coming from lee\noutput:\n    kh, gss, lsss, leess: .tex file\n    sq2: text in Sage format\n    s: text\noptions:\n  -r         : compute reduced theory\n  -h         : print this message\n  -o <file>  : write output to <file>\n                (stdout is the default)\n  -f <field> : ground field (if applicable)\n                (Z2 is the default)\n  -v         : verbose: report progress as the computation proceeds\n<field> can be one of:\n  Z2, Z3, Q\n<link> can be one of:\n  - the unknot, e.g. U or unknot\n  - a torus knot, e.g. T(2,3)\n  - a Rolfsen table knot, e.g. 10_124\n  - a Hoste-Thistlethwaite-Weeks knot, e.g. 11a12 or 12n214\n  - a Morwen Thistlethwaite link, e.g. L8n9 or L13n8862\n  - a planar diagram, e.g.\n      PD[X[1, 4, 2, 5], X[3, 6, 4, 1], X[5, 2, 6, 3]] or\n      PD[[1, 4, 2, 5], [3, 6, 4, 1], [5, 2, 6, 3]]\n  - a Dowker-Thistlethwaite code, e.g.\n      DTCode[6,8,2,4],\n      DT[dadbcda] or\n      DT[{6, -8}, {-10, 12, -14, 2, -4}]\n  - a braid, e.g. BR[2, {-1, -1, -1}]\n  - disjoint union (juxtaposition), e.g. T(2,3) U\n\n4. UPCOMING CHANGES\n\nThe following changes are currently planned:\n\n* support for Z/p, p arbitrary prime and F(x) field of rational functions\n* Roberts' totally twisted Khovanov homology\n* the E^3 page of the twisted spectral sequence Kh(L) => \\widehat{HF}(\\Sigma_L)\n* spectral sequences of PIDs: lsss over F[x], gss over Z\n* maps induced by cobordisms\n\n5. FOR DEVELOPERS\n\nIf you are interested in contributing to knotkit or using it for a new\napplication, please contact me: Cotton Seed\n(cotton@math.princeton.edu).  I am interested in developing knotkit to\nbe an open platform for performing computations arising in\nlow-dimensional topology.\n",
