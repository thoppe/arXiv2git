Where \"centre\" is defined as the centre of the largest circle that can be drawn within the polygon.\r\n\r\nIt is based on the process described in this paper http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1212/1212.3193.pdf *An Efficient Algorithm to Calculate the Center of the Biggest Inscribed Circle in an Irregular Polygon* by *OSCAR MARTINEZ*. See https://github.com/omtinez/CenterPolygon for the version by the paper's author in C.\r\n",
