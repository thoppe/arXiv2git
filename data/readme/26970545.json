  "README.md": "## Branch of Louis's Home Page\n\n## About \n\nThis repo is a modified version of the [Jekyll][jekyll] source to Louis Theran's \nhome page template.  As such, this README is an annotated version of that found [here.](https://github.com/theran/theran.github.io/tree/template)\n\n## License\n\nThe code and layouts are derived from Jekyll, and inherit that\nlicense.  \n\n[jekyll]: http://jekyllrb.com/\n\n## Documentation\n\nAt the moment, this is somewhat modular, except for the home page at \n`index.html` and the CV and `CV.html` which contain some free text \ninside the Liquid templates.\n\nBelow is a quick guide to some of the features.\n\n\n### Editing\nTo have posts added to link bar at top of page, add a shorttitle in their md file\n\nEdit the `_includes/aboutme.md` file to change the main page body content.\nEdit the `_includes/picture.html` to pull a picture from the `_assets` folder and also change title and affiliations.  \nThe `_index.html` file in the main folder should be used to collate other pieces.\nThe `_includes/footer.html` file can be edited to remove the github and twitter links etc.\nThe `_layouts` has various templates for collections/.md files. \n\n### Papers\n\nThese are part of the collection `_papers`.  (This folder should be added.)  A typical journal article \nfrontmatter looks like this:\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n---\nlayout: paper\ntype: journal\narxiv: 1008.1837\ndoi: 10.1016/j.aim.2012.10.007\njournal: advances\nauthors:\n    - justin\n    - louis\ntitle: Generic combinatorial rigidity of periodic frameworks\nyear: 2013\nvolume: 233\nissue: 1\npages: 291-331\n---\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe body is the abstract.  \nSee this site for conference and preprint examples.  Authors conferences and journals \nare listed in `_data/authors.yml`, `_data/conferences.yml`, and `_data/journals.yml`.\nThis is enough to automatically generate your bibliography.\n\n### CV\n\nSee `CV.html` for a semi-automated CV generator, that should be somewhat updatable.\n\n### Styling\n\nThis is derived pretty closely from the Jekyll default.  I've (Louis) tried to make \nthings even a little more modular, but I only noticed how SCSS mixins work\nrecently, so more can be done.",
