  "README.md": "distcomp\n========\n\nInstall this package the usual way in R or via:\n\n```{r}\nlibrary(devtools)\ninstall_github(\"hrpcisd/distcomp\")\n```\n\nThen, you will find a document that describes several examples\ninstalled under the R library tree. For example:\n\n```{r}\nlist.files(system.file(\"doc\", package = \"distcomp\"))\nlist.files(system.file(\"doc_src\", package = \"distcomp\"))\n```\n\nThe examples described in the arxiv paper are available as follows:\n\n```{r}\nlist.files(system.file(\"ex\", package = \"distcomp\"))\n```\n\nUse of this package requires some configuration. In particular, to run\nthe examples on a local machine where a single `opencpu` server will\nbe emulating several sites, a suitable R profile needs to be set\nup. That profile will be something along the lines of\n\n```{r, eval=FALSE}\nlibrary(distcomp)\ndistcompSetup(workspace = \"full_path_to_workspace_directory\",\n              ssl.verifyhost = 0L, ssl.verifypeer = 0L)\n```\nwhere the workspace is a directory that the `opencpu` server can\nserialize objects to. On Unix or Mac, the above can be inserted into\nan `.Rprofile` file, but on Windows, we find that the `Rprofile.site`\nfile needs to contain the above lines.\n\nThe effect of this is that _every R_ process (including the `opencpu`\nprocess) has access to the `distcomp` library and the workspace.\n\n\n## OSX Yosemite Issues (10.10.4 and below)\n\nIn some earlier versions of Yosemite (MacOS 10.10.2 for example) there\nwere issues with the `opencpu` package. We suspected it had more to do\nwith Yosemite than `opencpu` or `httpuv`---see the number of DNS\nresolver issues people are having with the move to `discoveryd` via a\ngoogle search.\n\nFurthermore, even if `opencpu` came up, which it did sometimes after\nmany tries, you were better off using the ip address `127.0.0.1` in\nthe url in place of `localhost` due to those DNS problems.\n\nWe no longer see this problem in recent versions of Yosemite\n(10.10.5).\n",
