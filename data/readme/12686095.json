  "README.md": "void-lensing\n============\n\nThis repository contains data and python code for the stacked weak-lensing measurement of cosmic voids in SDSS, as presented in the paper \n*First measurement of gravitational lensing by cosmic voids in SDSS* by Peter Melchior, P.M. Sutter, Erin S. Sheldon, Elisabeth Krause and Benjamin D. Wandelt:\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1309.2045\n\nThe file [voids_rebinned.py](voids_rebinned.py) provides a reasonably detailed example of the code capabilities, most importantly the calculation of the E/B-mode lensing profile around voids in predefined bins of r/R_v, including errors from bootstrap resampling.",
