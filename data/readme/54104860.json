This is for a \"Quantum Coffee\" talk given at MPQ on the 17/03/2016. The algorithm was introduced by G. Evenbly and G. Vidal in the paper\n\nG. Evenbly and G. Vidal, Phys. Rev. Lett. 115, 180405 (2015)\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.115.180405\n\nbut the code is based on:\n\nG. Evenbly,\tarXiv:1509.07484\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1509.07484\n\nAdditional functions required to run the scripts here are:\n\nncon: R. N. C. Pfeifer, G. Evenbly, S. Singh, G. Vidal, arXiv:1402.0939.\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1402.0939\n\nnetcon: R. N. C. Pfeifer, J. Haegeman, F. Verstraete, arXiv:1304.6112.\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1304.6112\n\nBoth of which can be downloaded by selecting \"other formats\" and \"download source\" on arXiv.\n\nPlease note that this code is meant for illustrative purposes only.\n",
