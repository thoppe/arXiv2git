The latent residual variance estimates are then used as\r\npredictors in a regression of another outcome.\r\n\r\n[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/varian)](http://cran.r-project.org/package=varian)\r\n\r\n# Getting Started\r\n\r\nAt its core, `varian` uses [`Stan`](http://mc-stan.org) to estimate the\r\nmodels.\r\n\r\n## Prerequisites\r\n\r\n### R\r\n\r\n`R` version 3.1.1 or later is required.  You can download the latest\r\nversion of `R` here:\r\n\r\n<http://www.r-project.org/>\r\n\r\n### Tools\r\n\r\n`Stan` and the `varian` package rely on being able to compile `C++`\r\ncode.\r\n\r\n* For Windows, download and install Rtools at\r\n  <http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>\r\n* For Mac, make sure you have the latest version of Xcode installed.\r\n  The installation instructions for `rstan` provide more details.\r\n* For Linux, make sure you have a recent version of ge++ or clang++.\r\n\r\n### RStan\r\n\r\nInstall the latest version of the\r\n[`rstan`](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started)\r\npackage, which you can do from CRAN now.  That page also lists more\r\ndetailed directions for getting the necessary tools installed.\r\n\r\n    ```R\r\n\tinstall.packages(\"rstan\", dependencies = TRUE)\r\n\t```\r\n\r\n## Install varian\r\n\r\nYou can install:\r\n\r\n* the latest stable release (0.2.2) from CRAN\r\n\r\n    ```R\r\n\tinstall.packages(\"varian\", dependencies = TRUE)\r\n\t```\r\n\r\n* the latest development version from github\r\n\r\n    ```R\r\n\tinstall.packages(\"devtools\")\r\n\tdevtools::install_github(\"ElkhartGroup/varian\")\r\n\t```\r\n\r\n## Learn about the theory\r\n\r\nSee our open access pre-print on the arXiv <http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2961>.\r\n\r\n\r\n# More\r\n\r\n* If you find a bug or have a feature request, please let us know on\r\n  the issue tracker: <https://github.com/ElkhartGroup/varian/issues>.\r\n\r\n* Have questions or need support?
