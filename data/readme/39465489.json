  "README.md": "# Enigma\nContains analyses of publicly available data from Enigma.io\nand other data sources present online. Each analysis contains \nthe source files, the csv file from which the data was analyzed, \nand a quick summary of the results that were obtained/notable \nobservations. The following are the\nprojects on which I have currently worked:\n\nPrisons\n=============================================================\nContains analysis on the locations of prisons in the US: had to\nimplement the geocoder API for use in locating prisons that were\ngiven incomplete address in the raw data provided. Further, I \nmapped the locations of the prisons overlaid on a US socio-economic\nmap, allowing to see the relation between the two.\n\nArXiV\n=============================================================\nContains analysis regarding how the citations and collaboration\nnetworks are distributed in the online source of ArXiV. Thus far,\nI have only worked on the degree distribution, though I hope to\nfurther this work, looking into the relation between clusters in\nthe two. Such wold implicate that those who are collaborating on\nprojects tend to reciprocate their good relations through citing\none another.\n\nEmissions/Biofuel\n=============================================================\nInvestigates the relation between the emissions and biofuel\nproduction over time, and attempting to explain any major \nfluctuation in the trends with external events\n\nGnutella\n=============================================================\nInvestigates the general trends in peer-to-peer sharing \nnetwork data over time, seeking to find how behavior of others\nchanges with time.",
