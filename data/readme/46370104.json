  "README.md": "# CNN-Prediction\nA fast version of cnn prediction\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a great tool to solve computer vision and image processing problem. \nMany times, it works like a charm. However, under certain scenario, dense scanning, applying cnn model on \neach image pixel, is really computational expensive.\n\nThis project implemented a fast version of dense scanning, it has the same result as exactly sliding window (stride is 1),\nand much faster. It has following features:\n\n1. The model is trained from image patches using caffe (https://github.com/BVLC/caffe).\n\n2. The filters learned are applied on whole image\n\n3. Specially handling is taken care in the forward part of max-pooling layer to avoid misalignment\n\n4. The result is the same as stride 1 based sliding window\n\n\nOne test image is like this:\n![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fujun-liu/CNN-Prediction/master/Bmal1%20WT%2317-3_1.jpg)\n\n# Result\nAnd the cnn classification for each image pixel is like this:\n![alt tag](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fujun-liu/CNN-Prediction/master/edgemap.png)\n\n\nFor more details, check the original paper:\n@article{giusti2013fast,\n  title={Fast image scanning with deep max-pooling convolutional neural networks},\n  author={Giusti, Alessandro and Cire{\\c{s}}an, Dan C and Masci, Jonathan and Gambardella, Luca M and Schmidhuber, J{\\\"u}rgen},\n  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1302.1700},\n  year={2013}\n}\n\n",
