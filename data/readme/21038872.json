  "README.md": "pyPWA\n=====\nAbout:\nWelcome to the Python Partial Wave Analysis (PWA) Toolkit repository.  The aim of this project is to provide an easy to use python toolset for working with common data formats encountered in accelerator research projects (.bamp, .gamp, etc) as well as a full partial wave analysis framework and toolset to simulate and fit data as per the model proposed by Dr. Carlos Salgado and Dr. Dennis Weygand and described in detail here: http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.7498.\n\nHistory:\nThis repository contains the source code of the main project I worked on while I was at The Thomas Jefferson National Accelerator Facility (JLAB).  I used this work as my senior thesis for my Bachelors of Physics at Old Dominion University, thus this repository represents the final version of this project submitted to my senior thesis committee.  After I presented this project to my university I continued to work on it and make improvements.  This resulted in a newer version which is being stored under the JLAB user account here on GitHub.  Currently this newer version is still contained in a private repository, but it should be released shortly.  Once that repo is publicly available, I will provide a link to it within this document.\n",
