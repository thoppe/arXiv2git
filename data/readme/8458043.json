  "readme.txt": "=== KCite ===\n\nContributors: philliplord, sjcockell, knowledgeblog, d_swan\nTags: references, citations, doi, crossref, pubmed, bibliography, pmid, res-comms, scholar, academic, science\nRequires at least: 3.0\nTested up to: 3.3.1\nStable tag: 1.6.2\n\nA tool for producing citations and bibliographies in Wordpress posts.\nDeveloped for the Knowledgeblog project (http://knowledgeblog.org).\n\n\n\n== Description ==\n\nInterprets the &#91;cite&#93; shortcode to produce citations from the\nappropriate sources, also produces a formatted bibliography at the foot of the\npost, with appropriate links to articles.\n\nThis plugin now uses multiple resources to retrieve metadata about the\nreferences in question, including CrossRef, DataCite, arXiv, PubMed and\narbitrary URLs.\n\nAdditional documentation is available at\n[Process](http://process.knowledgeblog.org/category/kcite). \n\n**Syntax**\n\nDOI Example - &#91;cite source='doi'&#93;10.1021/jf904082b&#91;/cite&#93;\n\nPMID example - &#91;cite source='pubmed'&#93;17237047&#91;/cite&#93;\n\nWhichever 'source' is identified as the default (see Installation), will work\nwithout the source attribute being set in the shortcode. so:\n\n&#91;cite&#93;10.1021/jf904082b&#91;/cite&#93;\n\nWill be interpreted correctly as long as DOI is set as the default metadata\nsource.\n\nKcite now supports DOIs from both [CrossRef](http://www.crossref.org) and\n[DataCite](http://www.datacite.org). Identifiers from\n[PubMed](http://www.pubmed.org) or [arXiv](http://www.arxiv.org) are directly\nsupported. URLs are supported via\n[Greycite](http://greycite.knowledgeblog.org).\n\n\nFrom Kcite 1.4, Citeproc-js\n(https://bitbucket.org/fbennett/citeproc-js/wiki/Home) is used to render the\nbibliography on the browser; the main visible change it that Author-Year\ncitation is used. There is now experimental support for reader switching. This\nmust be enabled in the settings page as it is off by default. \n\nKcite is developed at http://code.google.com/p/knowledgeblog/ in Mercurial. To\ncontact the authors, please email knowledgeblog@googlegroups.com.\n\n== Installation ==\n\n1. Unzip the downloaded .zip archive to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory\n1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress\n1. Using the plugin settings page, set which identifier you want processed as the default.\n\n\n== Upgrade Notice ==\n\n= 1.6.3 =\n\nOptional feature release: Inline citations now supported. \n\n= 1.6.2 = \nSecurity weakness on admin page. All users advised to update.\n\n= 1.6 =\nKcite now supports referencing of Arbitrary URLs. \n\n== Changelog ==\n\n= 1.6.3 =\n\n1. Link from Plugins menu\n1. Inline citations now supported.\n\n= 1.6.2 = \n\n1. Security fix: Admin page was incorrectly nonced. \n1. Admin page has been completely re-written\n1. Greycite options have been updated. \n1. Options will need resetting as a result of change.\n\n= 1.6.1 = \n\n1. Fixed problem with in-built render giving links of form [ITEM-8-1]\n1. Improvements to presentation of in-built renderer\n1. Citeproc rendering disabled in feeds, as many RSS readers cannot cope\n1. Kcite can selects appropriate sources for bare URLs\n1. Paged rendering to citeproc-js should allow large bibliographies in IE8,\n   without timeouts. \n\n= 1.6 = \n\n1. Kcite no longer requires PHP libcurl, but will use it if present. \n1. Javascript rendering now happens asynchronously, reducing page load time. \n1. Options to control caching. \n1. Kcite can now reference URLs, using metadata from Greycite (greycite.knowledgeblog.org)\n\n= 1.5.1 =\n\n1. Fixed Version number in header\n\n= 1.5 =\n\n1. Kcite now requires the PHP libcurl support. You may need to install\n   additional packages on your web server. \n1. From kcite 1.5, we have expanded the range of identifiers.\n   DataCite DOIs and arXiv IDs are now supported. \n1. Crossref DOIs are now accessed via content negotiation. This should be less\n   buggy, and reduce server load as it removes a parsing/data integration\n   step. \n1. DataCite DOIs come via content negotiation also, although still require XML\n   parsing. \n1. Bug fix to in kcite.js should fix an occasional rendering bug.\n1. Both bibliography and intext citation are now linked. The underlying HTML\n   is also linked, which should aid machine interpretability. \n\n= 1.4.4 =\n\n1. Removed errant \"w\" from start of kcite.php\n\n= 1.4.3 =\n\n1. Proper release, after 1.4.2 release was confused.\n\n= 1.4.2 = \n\n1. Javascript was being added when citeproc option was turned off.\n\n= 1.4.1 =\n\n1. Loads Javascript only when there is a bibliography.\n1. Fixed bug in Crossref parser which treated editors as authors\n\n= 1.4 = \n\n1. Introduction of citeproc rendering\n1. New admin options\n1. Move to GPLv3\n\n= 1.3 = \n1. Fixed another regression caused by 1.2 fix. This should fix the error when\n   there is no bibliography. \n\n= 1.2 = \n1. Sadly 1.1 had a regression error in it, which mean it didn't \n   fix the error in as reported. Additionally a print statement \n   was dumping a large amount of JSON to screen. Both of these errors\n   should now be fixed. \n= 1.1 =\n1. Fix for pages with more than one bibliography. \n   http://code.google.com/p/knowledgeblog/issues/detail?id=28\n= 1.0 =\n1. Full code refactoring from 0.1\n1. Uses transients API\n1. Support for arbitrary reference terms\n\n== Upgrade Notice ==\n\n= 1.5.2 =\n1. Support for URLs through Greycite. \n= 1.4 =\n1. Client side rendering of the bibliography. \n= 1.1 =\n1. none critical bug fix release\n= 1.0 =\n1.0 release is fully refactored for speed and stability.\n\n== Copyright ==\n\nThis plugin is copyright Phillip Lord, Simon Cockell and Newcastle University\nand is licensed under GPLv3.
