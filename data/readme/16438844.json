  "README.md": "*Last update: 04/17/14*\nDESCRIPTION\n-----------\n\nThis is code related to kernel-based Markov blanket discovery, either by conditional dependence-based or dependence-based approximation methods.\n\n- *BackCD* and *ForCD* use a conditional dependence-based measure and are from: Strobl EV & Visweswaran S. Markov Blanket Ranking using Kernel-based Conditional Dependence Measures. NIPS Workshop on Causality, 2013. http://arxiv-web3.library.cornell.edu/abs/1402.0108\n\n- *BAHSIC* and *FOHSIC* use a dependence-based measure and are from: Song L, Smola A, Gretton A, Bedo J, and Borgwardt K. Feature Selection via Dependence Maximization. JMLR, 2007.\n\n- *HSIClasso* can be found here: http://www.makotoyamada-ml.com/hsiclasso.html\n\nCODE\n----\n\nPlease download the entire package (including the utility functions)\n\n*Main Methods*\n\n- BackCD.m - Find Markov blanket by backward elimination. Variables are in \"ascending\" order (least to most likely). More accurate.\n\n- ForCD.m - Find Markov blanket by forward selection. Variables are in \"descending\" order (most to least likely). Faster.\n\n- BAHSIC.m - Backward eliminiation by HSIC as described by Song et al. (2007). Ascending order.\n\n- FOHSIC.m - Forward selection by HSIC as described by Song et al. (2007). Descending order.\n\n*Others*\n\n- CreateArtificialMB.m - Creates an artificial Markov blanket with linear relationships\n\n- demo.m - Examples\n\n",
