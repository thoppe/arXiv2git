The window is adapted to a chosen part of the signal (TF component). This window gives a sparser representation of the component.\n\nThis code is an implementation of the methods described in the following papers:\n\nRicaud, B., Stempfel, G., Torresani, B., Wiesmeyr, C., Lachambre, H., & Onchis, D.
