  "README.md": "Synopsis\n--------\n\n    ./run.sh\n\nThis samples from the prior and posterior distributions and performs a\nforecast. The `oct/` directory contains a few functions for plotting these\nresults (GNU Octave and OctBi required).\n\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nThis package is based on a single-box NPZD (nutrient, phytoplankton,\nzooplankton and detritus) marine biogeochemical model. It consists of 15\nparameters and 15 state variables. Four of the state variables (the $N$, $P$,\n$Z$ and $D$) interact via a system of differential equations, with flux\nbetween them determined by various nonlinear processes computed from the\nremaining state variables, each of which is allowed to vary over time\nfollowing a first-order stochastic autoregressive process.\n\nThis version of the model was introduced in Parslow et al. (2013). Its\nbehaviour under sampling with the particle marginal Metropolis-Hastings (PMMH)\nsampler was studied in Murray, Jones & Parslow (2013), then further studied\nusing a bridge particle filter in Del Moral & Murray (2014).\n\nA real data set is provided from the site of Ocean Station Papa (OSP), taken\nfrom Matear (1995).\n\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nParslow, J.; Cressie, N.; Campbell, E.
