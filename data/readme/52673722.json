  "README.md": "# TeenGalaxies\nDo galaxies grow steadily or in spurts?\n\nThis research studies galaxies in the epoch called cosmic noon, about 8 billion years ago when galaxies actively formed.  These analyses include some of the faintest galaxies that can be detected with the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nI and collaborators seek to understand whether galaxies form their stars gradually over time or suddenly in fits and starts.  Our paper is available on arXiv [here](http://lanl.arxiv.org/abs/1602.03909) and is published in The Astrophysical Journal Letters (Kurczynski et al. 2016)\n\nHere are the data and code (in Python) to analyze intrinsic scatter in the Star Formation Rate (SFR) vs. Stellar Mass (M*) relationship of star-forming galaxies in the Hubble Ultradeep Field (HUDF) and the surrounding area (CANDELS/GOODS-S) in five redshift bins.\n",
