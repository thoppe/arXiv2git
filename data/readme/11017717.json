All optimization algorithms included in mystic\nprovide workflow at the fitting layer, not just access to the algorithms\nas function calls. Mystic gives the user fine-grained power to both\nmonitor and steer optimizations as the fit processes are running.\n\nWhere possible, mystic optimizers share a common interface, and thus can\nbe easily swapped without the user having to write any new code. Mystic\nsolvers all conform to a solver API, thus also have common method calls\nto configure and launch an optimization job. For more details, see\n`mystic.abstract_solver`. The API also makes it easy to bind a favorite\n3rd party solver into the mystic framework.\n\nBy providing a robust interface designed to allow the user to easily\nconfigure and control solvers, mystic reduces the barrier to implementing\na target fitting problem as stable code. Thus the user can focus on\nbuilding their physical models, and not spend time hacking together an\ninterface to optimization code.\n\nMystic is in the early development stages, and any user feedback is\nhighly appreciated. Contact Mike McKerns [mmckerns at caltech dot edu]\nwith comments, suggestions, and any bugs you may find.  A list of known\nissues is maintained at http://trac.mystic.cacr.caltech.edu/project/mystic/query.\n\nMajor Features\n--------------\nMystic provides a stock set of configurable, controllable solvers with::\n\n* a common interface\n* the ability to impose solver-independent bounds constraints\n* the ability to apply solver-independent monitors\n* the ability to configure solver-independent termination conditions\n* a control handler yielding: [pause, continue, exit, and user_callback]\n* ease in selecting initial conditions: [initial_guess, random]\n* ease in selecting mutation strategies (for differential evolution)\n\nTo get up and running quickly, mystic also provides infrastructure to::\n\n* easily generate a fit model (several example models are included)\n* configure and auto-generate a cost function from a model\n* extend fit jobs to parallel & distributed resources\n* couple models with optimization parameter constraints [COMING SOON]\n\n\nCurrent Release\n---------------\nThe latest released version of mystic is available from::\n    http://trac.mystic.cacr.caltech.edu/project/mystic\n\nMystic is distributed under a 3-clause BSD license.\n\nDevelopment Release\n-------------------\nYou can get the latest development release with all the shiny new features at::\n    http://dev.danse.us/packages.\n\nor even better, fork us on our github mirror of the svn trunk::\n    https://github.com/uqfoundation\n\nCitation\n--------\nIf you use mystic to do research that leads to publication, we ask that you\nacknowledge use of mystic by citing the following in your publication::\n\n    M.M. McKerns, L. Strand, T. Sullivan, A. Fang, M.A.G. Aivazis,\n    \"Building a framework for predictive science\", Proceedings of\n    the 10th Python in Science Conference, 2011;\n    http://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.1056\n\n    Michael McKerns, Patrick Hung, and Michael Aivazis,\n    \"mystic: a simple model-independent inversion framework\", 2009- ;\n    http://trac.mystic.cacr.caltech.edu/project/mystic\n\nMore Information\n----------------\nProbably the best way to get started is to look at the tutorial examples provided\nwithin the user's guide.  The source code is also generally well documented,\nso further questions may be resolved by inspecting the code itself, or through \nbrowsing the reference manual. For those who like to leap before\nthey look, you can jump right to the installation instructions. If the aforementioned documents\ndo not adequately address your needs, please send us feedback.\n\nMystic is an active research tool. There are a growing number of publications and presentations that\ndiscuss real-world examples and new features of mystic in greater detail than presented in the user's guide. \nIf you would like to share how you use mystic in your work, please send us a link.\n",
