  "README.md": "Forked from https://www.github.com/BVLC/caffe master branch in 2016/02/04 . Next update time may be around 2016/05/01 .\n\n**Good News:** Microsoft has created a repository of caffe windows version in https://github.com/Microsoft/caffe . Their solution may be more flexible and maintainable. I suggest all of you to try it.\n\nI have made a list of some frequently asked questions in [FAQ.md](FAQ.md). If you get confused during configuring, please firstly look up for your question in the [FAQ.md](FAQ.md). This FAQ list is still under construction, I will keep adding questions into it.\n\n## Setup step:\n\n1. Download third-party libraries from [BaiduYun Disk](http://pan.baidu.com/s/1sk3QyyL) or [OneDrive](http://1drv.ms/23KkbTk) and extract the files to `caffe-windows_root/3rdparty/`. **Please don't forget to add the `./3rdparty/bin` folder to your environment variable `PATH`.**\n\n2. Run `./src/caffe/proto/extract_proto.bat` to create `caffe.pb.h`, `caffe.pb.cc` and `caffe_pb2.py`.\n\n3. Double click ./buildVS2013/MainBuilder.sln to open the solution. If you do not have a Nvidia GPU, please open ./build_cpu_only/MainBuilder.sln.\n\n4. Change the compile mode to Release and X64.\n\n5. Modify the cuda device compute capability defined in the settings (`caffelib properties` -> `CUDA C/C++` -> `Device` -> `Code Generation`) to your GPU's compute capability (such as compute_30,sm_30; etc). You can look up for your GPU's compute capability in https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA . Some general GPUs' compute capabilities are listed below.\n\n - If your GPU's compute capability is below or equal to 2.1, please remove the `USE_CUDNN` macro in the proprocessor definition of all projects.\n - If you are using cpu only solution, just ignore this step.\n\n6. Compile.\n\n| GPU                                         | Compute Capability    |\n| ------------------------------------------- |:---------------------:|\n| GTX660, 680, 760, 770                       | compute_30,sm_30      |\n| GTX780, Titan Z, Titan Black, K20, K40      | compute_35,sm_35      |\n| GTX960, 980, Titan X                        | compute_52,sm_52      |\n\n\nZhong Wen An Zhuang Shuo Ming :http://blog.csdn.net/happynear/article/details/45372231\n\n### Matlab Wrapper\n\nJust replace the Matlab include and library path defined in the settings and compile.\n**Don't forget to add `./matlab` to your Matlab path.**\n\n### Python Wrapper\n\nSimilar with Matlab, replace the python include and library path and compile.\n\nMost of the libraries listed in `./python/requirements.txt` can be installed by `pip install`. However, some of them cannot be installed so easily.\n\nFor protobuf, you may download the codes from https://github.com/google/protobuf. Copy `caffe-windows-root/src/caffe/proto/protoc.exe` to `protobuf-root/src`. Then run `python setup.py install` in `protobuf-root/python`.\n\nFor leveldb, I have created a repository https://github.com/happynear/py-leveldb-windows . Please follow the instructions in `README.md` to install it.\n\n### MNIST example\n\nPlease download the mnist leveldb database from http://pan.baidu.com/s/1mgl9ndu and extract it to `./examples/mnist`. Then double click `./run_mnist.bat` to run the MNIST demo.\n\n## Update log\n\n2015/11/09 CuDNN v3 works well now.\n\n2015/09/14 Multi-GPU is supported now. \n\nWARNING: When you are using multiple gpus to train a model, please do not directly close the command window. Instead, please use `Ctrl+C` to avoid the gpu driver from crash.\n\nYou can also press `Ctrl+Break` to save a model snapshot whenever you want during training.\n\n## License and Citation\n\nCaffe is released under the [BSD 2-Clause license](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/LICENSE).\nThe BVLC reference models are released for unrestricted use.\n\nPlease cite Caffe in your publications if it helps your research:\n\n    @article{jia2014caffe,\n      Author = {Jia, Yangqing and Shelhamer, Evan and Donahue, Jeff and Karayev, Sergey and Long, Jonathan and Girshick, Ross and Guadarrama, Sergio and Darrell, Trevor},\n      Journal = {arXiv preprint arXiv:1408.5093},\n      Title = {Caffe: Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding},\n      Year = {2014}\n    }\n",
