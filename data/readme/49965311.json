  "README.md": "# Simple Exploit for Verification of CVE-2015-6606\n\nThis is a simple exploit to verify a code injection vulnerability that exists in the\nSEEK smartcard service versions 3.1.0 and below (CVE-2015-6606, Google internal bug#\nANDROID-22301786). The vulnerability allows specially crafted Android application\npackages to inject arbitrary code into the execution context of the smartcard system\nservice. This code inherits all permissions granted to this system service, which\ninclude signature-or-system permissions that are not normally granted to third party\napps.\n\nFurther details can be found in our report *Executing Arbitrary Code in the Context\nof the Smartcard System Service* (see literature section below).\n\n\n\n## DISCLAIMER\n\nYou are using this application at your own risk. *We are not responsible for any\ndamage caused by this application, incorrect usage or inaccuracies in this manual.*\n\n\n\n## LITERATURE\n\n- [CVE-2015-6606](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2015-6606)\n- Google: [Nexus Security Bulletin - October 2015](http://source.android.com/security/bulletin/2015-10-01.html)\n- M.
