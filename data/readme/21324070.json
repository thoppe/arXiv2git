  "README.md": "Brain cell finder\n=================\n\nBrain cell finder is a tool for fully automated localization of soma in 3D mouse brain images acquired by confocal light sheet microscopy. Parts of the method are detailed in [1] where bcfind was applied to the localization of Purkinje cells in a whole mouse cerebellum.\n\n\nFor documentation, please see the [bcfind page at DINFO, Universita di Firenze](http://bcfind.dinfo.unifi.it \"bcfind\").\n\n\n\nNews\n----\n\nRelease 1.1 includes several improvements. In particular:\n- Cell detection is significantly faster\n- Support of multiview images with a hierarchical registration pipeline and Multiview Semantic Deconvolution (MSD).\n\nThe method for multiview images is described in [2] Where it has been applied to the extraction of the activation map in a whole Arc-dVenus mouse brain.\n\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n[1] Frasconi, P., Silvestri, L., Soda, P., Cortini, R., Pavone, F.
