Natural Language Processing exercise.\n\nThe goal of this project is to collect all hep-ex abstracts on the arXiv and provide a visualization about the history of particles over time. As an obvious example, how many papers were about the Higgs boson in the last decade?\n\nTools used: a little class which I have written to retrieve data from the arXiv API (which uses the OAI-PMH protocol), mongoDB to store all the abstracts on the cloud, D3 to create the visualization.\n\n#### How to create the csv files\n    ipython\n    from arXiv_helper import create_particle_csv\n    create_particle_csv('muon')",
