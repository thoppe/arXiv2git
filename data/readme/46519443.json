Please refer to http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.04581.pdf\n\nAn example is provided under Example_Vae.py which trains two varational auto-encoders and then compares their samples to a holdout set using MMD.\n\nThe Relative MMD computations need to be exact to assure their validity. Thus matrix operations can be costly. Please make sure you have a properly configured numpy installation (linked to optimized blas libraries like openblas).\n\nFor a matlab version of the Relative MMD test please see https://github.com/wbounliphone/relative_similarity_test\n\nFor questions and or bug reports please dont hesitate to contact eugene.belilovsky@inria.fr\n",
