Some of the highlights\ninclude:\n\n- reading, writing, and manipulating phylogenetic trees\n- reconciling gene-trees with species-trees\n- inferring gene duplications, losses, and horizontal transfers\n- methods for coalescent processes, incomplete lineage sorting\n- methods for ancestral recombination graphs (ARGs)\n- finding syntenic regions (i.e. co-linear orthology) between genomes\n- processing common file formats: FASTA, PHYLIP, newick, nexus, etc.\n\nIn addition to computational biology-specific methods, this package also\ncontains general utilities for working with scientific data:\n\n- sparse matrix file formats\n- reading, writing, and manipulating tables of data\n- working with intervals (e.g. intersection, union, etc)\n- plotting (Gnuplot, Rpy)\n- statistics\n- general data-structures and algorithms:\n  quad trees, Union-Find, HHMs, clustering\n\n## Download\n\nThe `compbio` package is available for download from several sources:\n\n- https://github.com/mdrasmus/compbio\n- https://pypi.python.org/pypi/compbio\n\n## Requirements\n\nMost modules in this package can be used without any additional dependencies.\n\nFor plotting modules, the dependencies include:\n\n- [gnuplot](http://www.gnuplot.info/)\n- [R](http://www.r-project.org/)\n\nFor some scientific methods, the dependencies include:\n\n- [scipy](http://www.scipy.org/)\n\nFor development of the `compbio` package itself, dependencies can be installed\nwith `pip`:\n\n```\npip install -r requirements-dev.txt\n```\n\n## INSTALL\n\nThe `compbio` package is available on pypi, and can be installed using pip:\n```\npip install compbio\n```\n\nThese packages can be installed from the source directory using:\n```\npython setup.py install\n```\n\nOptionally, the libraries can be used directly from the source directory by\nconfiguring one's environment variables as follows (assuming bash shell):\n\n```\nexport PATH=$PATH:path/to/compbio/bin\nexport PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:path/to/compbio\n```\n\n## Author\n\nThese libraries were built up over the course of the Ph.D. of the\nauthor, Matthew D. Rasmussen (http://mattrasmus.com,\n<rasmus@alum.mit.edu>). Many of the methods here were utilized in\nseveral published software projects including:\n\n- [ARGweaver](http://mdrasmus.github.io/argweaver/):\n  Rasmussen, Siepel. Genome-wide inference of ancestral\n  recombination graphs. ArXiv. 2013.\n- [DLCoal](http://compbio.mit.edu/dlcoal/):\n  Rasmussen, Kellis. Unified modeling of gene duplication,\n  loss, and coalescence using a locus tree.  Genome Research. 2012.\n- [SPIMAP](http://compbio.mit.edu/spimap/):\n  Rasmussen, Kellis. A Bayesian approach for fast and accurate\n  gene tree reconstruction. Molecular Biology and Evolution. 2010.\n- [SPIDIR](http://compbio.mit.edu/spidir/):\n  Rasmussen, Kellis. Accurate gene-tree reconstruction by\n  learning gene- and species-specific substitution rates across multiple\n  complete genomes. Genome Research. 2007.\n\n*Minor note:* Although the libraries of this package supports each of\nthese software packages, this package is not a required\ndependency. Instead each software package contains its own private\ncopy of modules taken from this package.\n",
