It's a text based recommendation app for scientific literature.  Given a description of your research interests, the app finds the most likely interesting scientific articles for you based on a database of approx 50000 articles worth of metadata.  All of the metadata comes from Arxiv.org.  Currently, the database best spans theoretical high energy physics, but also touches the cross listed subjects like math, CS, astrophysics etc.  In this repository you'll find the code which accesses the Arxiv API and gets the metadata, a few preprocessing programs for the text data, a TF-IDF classification, LDA topic modeling and a few examples of time series analysis with ARIMA models.  There is also a web-app contained in here as well, which is running on abstraction.me.  \n\nThe program GetDataRestart.py calls the Arxiv API and gets the metadata for the articles.  The search parameters and the number of queries to make can be adjusted as well as the wait time between queries.  \n\nAll of the raw metadata is contained in the file ALL_Metadata.csv.  Ultimately, I put all of this into a MYSQL database from within MYSQL.  You'll have to do this as well if you want to use the web app (as it calls the database to find the recommended articles), but for everything else, the csv file will do fine.  There is also a test csv file called Just_a_test.csv, which contains a small subset of all of the data if you just want to play around quickly.  NOTE: you can change any of the file paths in at the top of the programs to suit whatever works for you.  \n",
