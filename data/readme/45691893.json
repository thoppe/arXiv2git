In total, the library contains\nthe highlights of 40 [research publications][SDSLLIT]. Succinct data structures\ncan represent an object (such as a bitvector or a tree) in space close to the\ninformation-theoretic lower bound of the object while supporting operations\nof the original object efficiently. The theoretical time complexity of an\noperation performed on the classical data structure and the equivalent\nsuccinct data structure are (most of the time) identical.\n\nWhy SDSL?\n--------\n\nSuccinct data structures have very attractive theoretical properties. However,\nin practice implementing succinct data structures is non-trivial as they are\noften composed of complex operations on bitvectors. The SDSL Library provides\nhigh quality, open source implementations of many succinct data structures\nproposed in literature.\n\nSpecifically, the aim of the library is to provide basic and complex succinct\ndata structure which are\n\n  * Easy and intuitive to use (like the [STL][STL], which provides classical data structures),\n  * Faithful to the original theoretical results,\n  * Capable of handling large inputs (yes, we support 64-bit),\n  * Provide efficient construction of all implemented succinct data structures,\n  while at the same time enable good run-time performance.\n\n<a href=\"http://simongog.github.io/assets/data/space-vis.html\" >\n<img align=\"right\" src=\"extras/resources/space-vis.png?raw=true\" />\n</a>\n\nIn addition we provide additional functionality which can help you use succinct\ndata structure to their full potential.\n\n  * Each data structure can easily be serialized and loaded to/from disk.\n  * We provide functionality which helps you analyze the storage requirements of any\n  SDSL based data structure (see right)\n  * We support features such as hugepages and tracking the memory usage of each\n  SDSL data structure.\n  * Complex structures can be configured by template parameters and therefore\n    easily be composed. There exists one simple method which constructs\n    all complex structures.\n  * We maintain an extensive collection of examples which help you use the different\n    features provided by the library.\n  * All data structures are tested for correctness using a unit-testing framework.\n  * We provide a large collection of supporting documentation consisting of examples,\n    [cheat sheet][SDSLCS], [tutorial slides and walk-through][TUT].\n\nThe library contains many succinct data structures from the following categories:\n\n * Bitvectors supporting Rank and Select\n * Integer Vectors\n * Wavelet Trees\n * Compressed Suffix Arrays (CSA)\n * Balanced Parentheses Representations\n * Longest Common Prefix (LCP) Arrays\n * Compressed Suffix Trees (CST)\n * Range Minimum/Maximum Query (RMQ) Structures\n\nFor a complete overview including theoretical bounds see the\n[cheat sheet][SDSLCS] or the\n[wiki](https://github.com/simongog/sdsl-lite/wiki/List-of-Implemented-Data-Structures).\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nWe provide an extensive set of documentation describing all data structures\nand features provided by the library. Specifically we provide\n\n* A [cheat sheet][SDSLCS] which succinctly\ndescribes the usage of the library.\n* An doxygen generated [API reference][DOXYGENDOCS] which lists all types and functions\nof the library.\n* A set of [example](examples/) programs demonstrating how different features\nof the library are used.\n* A tutorial [presentation][TUT] with the [example code](tutorial/) using in the\nsides demonstrating all features of the library in a step-by-step walk-through.\n* [Unit Tests](test/) which contain small code snippets used to test each\nlibrary feature.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\nThe SDSL library requires:\n\n* A modern, C++11 ready compiler such as `g++` version 4.9 or higher or `clang` version 3.2 or higher.\n* The [cmake][cmake] build system.\n* A 64-bit operating system. Either Mac OS X or Linux are currently supported.\n* For increased performance the processor of the system should support fast bit operations available in `SSE4.2`\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo download and install the library use the following commands.\n\n```sh\ngit clone https://github.com/simongog/sdsl-lite.git\ncd sdsl-lite\n./install.sh\n```\n\nThis installs the sdsl library into the `include` and `lib` directories in your\nhome directory. A different location prefix can be specified as a parameter of\nthe `install.sh` script:\n\n```sh\n./install /usr/local/\n```\n\nTo remove the library from your system use the provided uninstall script:\n\n```sh\n./uninstall.sh\n```\n\nGetting Started\n------------\n\nTo get you started with the library you can start by compiling the following\nsample program which constructs a compressed suffix array (a FM-Index) over the\ntext `mississippi!`, counts the number of occurrences of pattern `si` and\nstores the data structure, and a space usage visualization to the\nfiles `fm_index-file.sdsl` and `fm_index-file.sdsl.html`:\n\n```cpp\n#include <sdsl/suffix_arrays.hpp>\n#include <fstream>\n\nusing namespace sdsl;\n\nint main() {\n    csa_wt<> fm_index;\n    construct_im(fm_index, \"mississippi!\", 1);\n    std::cout << \"'si' occurs \" << count(fm_index,\"si\") << \" times.\\n\";\n    store_to_file(fm_index,\"fm_index-file.sdsl\");\n    std::ofstream out(\"fm_index-file.sdsl.html\");\n    write_structure<HTML_FORMAT>(fm_index,out);\n}\n```\n\nTo compile the program using `g++` run:\n\n```sh\ng++ -std=c++11 -O3 -DNDEBUG -I ~/include -L ~/lib program.cpp -o program -lsdsl -ldivsufsort -ldivsufsort64\n```\n\nNext we suggest you look at the comprehensive [tutorial][TUT] which describes\nall major features of the library or look at some of the provided [examples](examples).\n\nTest\n----\n\nImplementing succinct data structures can be tricky. To ensure that all data\nstructures behave as expected, we created a large collection of unit tests\nwhich can be used to check the correctness of the library on your computer.\nThe [test](./test) directory contains test code. We use [googletest][GTEST]\nframework and [make][MAKE] to run the tests. See the README file in the\ndirectory for details.\n\nTo simply run all unit tests after installing the library type\n\n```sh\ncd sdsl-lite/build\nmake test-sdsl\n```\n\nNote: Running the tests requires several sample files to be downloaded from the web\nand can take up to 2 hours on slow machines.\n\n\nBenchmarks\n----------\n\nTo ensure the library runs efficiently on your system we suggest you run our\n[benchmark suite](benchmark). The benchmark suite recreates a\npopular [experimental study](http://arxiv.org/abs/0712.3360) which you can\ndirectly compare to the results of your benchmark run.\n\nBug Reporting\n------------\n\nWhile we use an extensive set of unit tests and test coverage tools you might\nstill find bugs in the library. We encourage you to report any problems with\nthe library via the [github issue tracking system](https://github.com/simongog/sdsl-lite/issues)\nof the project.\n\nThe Latest Version\n------------------\n\nThe latest version can be found on the SDSL github project page https://github.com/simongog/sdsl-lite .\n\nIf you are running experiments in an academic settings we suggest you use the\nmost recent [released](https://github.com/simongog/sdsl-lite/releases) version\nof the library. This allows others to reproduce your experiments exactly.\n\nLicensing\n---------\n\nThe SDSL library is free software provided under the GNU General Public License\n(GPLv3).
