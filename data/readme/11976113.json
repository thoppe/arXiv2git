It uses `tikz` in the design.\n\n### Title Page ###\n\nFor defining the *title page* one uses a couple of commands:\n\n- **In the preamble**: a command called `\\definethesis` which accepts two arguments, the *title* and the *author*.\n\n        \\definethesis{The title  %Here the title\n           }{The Author   %Here the Author\n           }\n\n- **In the body**: a command called `\\thesistitlepage` which takes three arguments:\n    - Name of the advisor,\n    - The thesis statement, and\n    - the date\n\n            \\thesistitlepage{Advisor: Iv\\'an Schmidt % Name of the advisor\n               }{Trabajo de tesis presentado en cumplimiento parcial de los requisitos para el grado de Magister en Ciencias, menci\\'on f\\'isica, de la Universidad T\\'ecnica Federico Santa Mar\\'ia. %The thesis statement\n               }{August, 2014 %The date\n               }\n\n\n### Front Matter ###\n\nAfter generating the title page, as customary in the `book` class, the front-matter can be declared using the command `\\frontmatter`.\n\n- For the front matter, page style *special*. That is achieved with the command `\\pagestyle{special}`\n\n- In order to generate the *committee page* (where the members of the committee sign the thesis), the class provides the command `\\committee` with accepts arguments in the form of a comma separated list, containing the *name* and *affiliation* of each member of the committee.\n\n\t\t\\committee{\n          {Iv\\'an Schmidt}{USM},\n          {Jorge Zanelli}{CECS},\n\t\t  {Claudio Dib}{USM},\n\t\t  {Stanley Kubrick}{Bates}\n\t\t}\n\n- There is a `\\Dedication` command which takes one argument. It places the dedicatory is placed in the lower part of the page and flushed right.\n\n- The class also provides a command to create a *creative commons* box. The command is `\\CC`. By default the box creates a *Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 Unported License* (`by-sa`) logo.\n\n### Main Matter ###\n\nIn this part of the document one should call the `\\chapter`s composing the thesis.\n\n- The first command after the `\\mainmatter` is `\\pagestyle{main}`, which changes the numeration of the pages and the format for the new chapters.\n- For the sake of clarity, the plain LaTeX files should be saved in the folder called `Documents`, and to insert their content into the thesis one uses the command `\\input{Documents/xxxxxxxx}`, where `xxxxxxxx` is the name of the file. **Note:** since only `tex` files are supposed to be on the folder, no extension is needed. *Example:*\n\n\t\t\\input{Documents/ch1}\n\t\t\\input{Documents/ch2}\n\t\t\\input{Documents/ch3}\n\n- As in a standard book, appendices can be included after the command `\\appendix`. Notice that the chapter numeration changes to *capitalised* alphabet letters. *Example:*\n\n\t\t\\appendix\n\t\t\\input{Documents/ap1}\n\t\t\\input{Documents/ap2}\n\n### Back Matter ###\n\nThe `\\backmatter` command denotes the ending of the body of the thesis, and at this stage one should add the **bibliography**.\n\nSince the best way of generating the bibliography is to use `bibtex`, in the `Base.tex` file a line of reference-calling was added.\n\n\t\\nocite{IAS1,IAS2,Gilmore,...,CY-friends}\n\nNotice that this is for the sake of completeness in the example... Please, remove this line when you start writing your manuscript!!!\n\nThe `bibtex` style used by the class is `utphys`, which is compatible with **arXiv** citations and **DOI** hyper-reference.\n\n\t\\bibliographystyle{utphys}\n\t\\bibliography{References}\n\t\\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{\\bibname}\n\n- Since `utphys.bst` is not included in the standard LaTeX distribution, it has been included in the bundle of files.\n- A (huge) exaple of bibfile called `References.bib` has been included as well. It is highly recommended that you start your own bibfile.\n- If you start your new bibfile, and you call it `YYYYYYYY.bib`, then you should change the command `\\bibliography{References}` to `\\bibliography{YYYYYYYY}`.\n",
