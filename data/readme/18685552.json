(2014) Rapid and deterministic estimation of probability densities using scale-free field theories.\n    arXiv:1312.6661 [physics.data-an]\n    \nCode: https://github.com/jbkinney/13_deft\n\nNote: An earlier version of this code was published on SourceForge at https://sourceforge.net/projects/densityestimation/. This will not be maintained and should be ignored.\n\n=== Instructions ===\n\nAll computations were performed using the Canopy Python Environment by Entought, available at https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/ \n\nThe file \"deft.py\" contains all the density estmation routines of DEFT. Just copy this file to any directory in which you want to peform density estimation. Note: kinney2013_utils.py is NOT required by deft.py\n\nTo see a simple demsontration of DEFT in 1 dimension, run \"demo.py\"\n\nTo recreate Figs. 1 and 2, run \"fig1_fig2_calculate.py\", then \"fig1_fig2_draw.py\"\n\nTo recreate Fig. 3, run \"fig3_calculate.py\", then \"fig3_draw.py\"\n\nTo recreate Fig. 4, run \"fig4_calculate.py\", then \"fig4_draw.py\"\n\n=== FILES ===\n\ndeft.py:\n\tContains all code for density estimation in 1D and 2D. See docstring for details.\n\nfig1_fig2_calculate.py:\n\tPerforms computations for Figs. 1 and 2\n\t\nfig1_fig2_draw.py:\n\tDraws Figs. 1 and 2\n\t\nfig1.pdf:\n\tFigure 1\n\t\nfig2.pdf:\n\tFigure 2\n\t\nfig3_calculate.py:\n\tPerforms computations for Fig. 3\n\t\nfig3_draw.py:\n\tDraws Fig. 3\n\t\nfig3.pdf:\n\tFigure 3\n\t\nfig4_calculate.py:\n\tPerforms computations for Fig. 4\n\t\nfig4_draw.py:\n\tDraws Fig. 4\n\t\nfig4.pdf:\n\tFigure 4\n\ndists.npy:\n\tData file containing results of comptuations for Fig. 3\n\nthings_1d.pk:\n\tData file containing results of computations for Figs. 1 and 2\n\nthings_2d.pk:\n\tData file containing results of computations for Fig. 4\n\nkinney2013_utils.py:\n\tContains miscellaneous functions used in the python scripts listed above. Is NOT required by deft.py\n",
