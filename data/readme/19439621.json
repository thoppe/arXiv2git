  "README.md": "memoir-thesis-cornell\n=====================\n\nLaTeX \"memoir\" template for Cornell University dissertation.  The generated\ndocument should (hopefully) comply with the university requirements for a\ndissertation while being more attractive than the university-provided templates.\nUse of the `memoir` package provides great flexibility when customizing the\nstyle and structure.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n* TeX Live 2013 (or later), or equivalent\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n1. Modify the title, author, and date in the preamble\n2. Modify the year on the copyright and abstract pages\n3. Add references to BibTeX database\n4. Replace placeholder text with the contents of your thesis\n5. Compile with `latexmk -pdf <filename>`\n\nNotes\n-----\n\n* The default font is Palatino, which is Cornell's primary typeface and is\n  freely available.  Unfortunately, Cornell's secondary typeface, Frutiger, is\n  not available for free.  The default sans-serif font is currently Helvetica,\n  but others (like Myriad) may be more appropriate.\n* The default bibliography style is `apsrev4-1`, which is a concise style used\n  by the American Physical Society's \"Physical Review\" journals.  While it may\n  not be ideally suited for a dissertation's bibliography, it does make good use\n  of the `doi` and arXiv-related fields.\n* The `apsrev4-1` bibliography style emphasizes \"et al.,\" which violates many\n  style guidelines.  A custom `.bst` file can remove this emphasis (and may be\n  added in the future).\n* No thesis using this template has yet been submitted, so I cannot guarantee\n  that it meets all of the formatting requirements at this time.\n",
