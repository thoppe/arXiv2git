  "README.md": "# Methods for anonymizing data for public distribution\n\nThis QGIS Processing provider plugin implements different methods for the\nanonymization of spatial data (typically point samples) with the goal of making\nthe data publicly available, while preserving the privacy of the individuals\nwhose information the dataset contains (see [3]).\n\nThe differential privacy algorithm is based on the algorithm outlined in [1]\nand implemented by Konstantinos Chatzikokolakis in the Location Guard\nbrowser extension [2].\n\n## Credits\n\n[1] Andres, M.E., Bordenabe, N.E., Chatzikokolakis, K., and Palamidessi, P.\n2013.
