To compile, just type\n\n$ make\n\nand the Makefile script will finish all the things.\n\nThe main programme is \"fdpa.R\",\n\n$ Rscript fdpa.R\n\nwhich outputs \"fdpa.report.Rdata\" where one finds all the results. To parse it, use \"parseFixedPan.R\". The code package is available on github: https://github.com/guoxin/pan.on.fix.git\n",
