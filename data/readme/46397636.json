For other models, 512x512 images were used. \n\n## Oversampling\nThe data labels are highly unbalanced. For a more stable training, oversampling was done to balance the class labels (approximately uniform distribution). Oversampling should be stopped in the later part of the training to avoid overfitting the \"rare\" classes. \n\n## Train/Validation Split\n90%/10% stratified random split using sklearn package.\n\n## Multi-Threaded Data Loading and Realtime Data Augmentation (Multiprocessing)\nImage batch is prefetched into a queue before being loaded onto GPU.\nWhile being prefetched, data is normalized and randomly augmented (rotate, flip, scale, shear) toavoid overfitting. In test time, the images are only rotated randomly.\n\n## Pairwise Merging of Features\nThere are two images per patient (left eye / right eye). To take this fact into account, the dense representations of the two eyes after the convolutional layers are concatenated before the last two fully-connected layers.\n\n## Ideas Tried\n- Dropout\n- All Convolutional Network (http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6806)\n- Multitask Learning (Optimizing for both classification and regression task)\n- Deep Residual Network (http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385)\n- Maxout Network (http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4389)\n- Batch Normalization (http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167)\n- Leaky ReLU (http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.00853)\n\n\n",
