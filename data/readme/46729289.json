It is key to many\nareas of science that report the results of classical hypothesis tests or\nconfidence intervals using the (generalized or profile) likelihood ratio as a\ntest statistic. At the same time, with the advance of computing technology, it\nhas become increasingly common that a simulator (or generative model) is used to\ndescribe complex processes that tie parameters of an underlying theory and\nmeasurement apparatus to high-dimensional observations. However, directly\nevaluating the likelihood function in these cases is often impossible or is\ncomputationally impractical.\n\nIn this context, the goal of this package is to provide tools for the\nlikelihood-free setup, including likelihood (or density) ratio estimation\nalgorithms, along with helpers to carry out inference on top of these.\n\n_This project is still in its early stage of development.
