DeconvNet model definition: http://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/research/deconvnet/model/DeconvNet/DeconvNet_inference_deploy.prototxt\n  0. Pre-trained DeconvNet weight: http://cvlab.postech.ac.kr/research/deconvnet/model/DeconvNet/DeconvNet_trainval_inference.caffemodel\n\n### Licence\n\nThis software is being made available for research purpose only.\nCheck LICENSE file for details.\n\n### System Requirements\n\nThis software is tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS (64bit).\n\n**Prerequisites** \n  0. MATLAB (tested with 2014b on 64-bit Linux)\n  0. prerequisites for caffe(http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html#prequequisites)\n\n### Installing DeconvNet\n\n**By running \"setup.sh\" you can download all the necessary file for training and inference include:**\n  0. caffe: you need modified version of caffe which support DeconvNet - https://github.com/HyeonwooNoh/caffe.git\n  0. data: data used for training stage 1 and 2\n  0. model: caffemodel of trained DeconvNet and other caffemodels required for training\n\n### Training DeconvNet\n\nTraining scripts are included in *./training/* directory\n\n**To train DeconvNet you can simply run following scripts in order:**\n  0. 001\\_start\\_train.sh : script for first stage training\n  0. 002\\_start\\_train.sh : script for second stage training\n  0. 003\\_start\\_make\\_bn\\_layer\\_testable : script converting trained DeconvNet with bn layer to inference mode\n\n### Inference EDeconvNet+CRF\n\nRun *run_demo.m* to reproduce EDeconvNet+CRF results on VOC2012 test data.\n\n**This script will generated EDeconvNet+CRF results through following steps:**\n  0. run FCN-8s and cache the score [cache\\_FCN8s\\_results.m]\n  0. generate DeconvNet score and apply ensemble with FCN-8s score, post processing with densecrf [generate\\_EDeconvNet\\_CRF\\_results.m]\n\n*EDeconvNet+CRF obtains 72.5 mean I/U on PASCAL VOC 2012 Test*\n\n**External dependencies [can be downloaded by running \"setup.sh\" script]**\n  0. FCN-8s model and weight file [https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/wiki/Model-Zoo]\n  0. densecrf with matlab wrapper [https://github.com/johannesu/meanfield-matlab.git]\n  0. cached proposal bounding boxes extracted with edgebox object proposal [https://github.com/pdollar/edges] \n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n",
