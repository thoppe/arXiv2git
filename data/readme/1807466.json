See gpl.txt included with this package.\n\n== Compiling ==\n\nFirst, to get your hands on the latest code from GitHub.\nIn a directory of your choice:\n\n\tgit clone --recursive https://github.com/aaronmcdaid/MaximalCliques.git\n\tmake clean justTheCliques cp5\n\n== Usage ==\n\n\n\t./justTheCliques your_edge_list.txt                         [--stringIDs]    > cliques.txt\n\t./cp5            your_edge_list.txt output_directory        [--stringIDs]\n\n- justTheCliques will output the cliques to standard output, hence you should\n  redirect it with \"> cliques.txt\" as in this example.\n- cp5 will create its output in a directory of your choice.\n\nor, if you just want cliques with at least 10 nodes in them,\n\n\t./justTheCliques your_edge_list.txt -k 10  [--stringIDs]    > cliques.txt\n\nthis should be a little faster. --stringIDs is to allow strings, not just integers\nin the input - see below.\n\nThe cliques themselves are printed to stdout (hence the redirection above). Various\nsummary stats are printed on stderr. So, if you didn't want the cliques but\ndid want to see the sizes of the cliques found, to\n\n\t./justTheCliques edge_list.txt       > /dev/null\n\n== Input file ==\n\nEach line of the your_edge_list.txt represents an edge. The first two fields\n(delimited by commas, pipes(|), spaces or tabs) are the names of the two\nnodes that are connected. Directionality is ignored, and self-loops will be rejected.\nAny other fields on the line are also ignored.\n\nBy default, the node names are integers (64-bit integers). But you can change\nthis with the --stringIDs option; note this will increase memory usage.\n\n",
