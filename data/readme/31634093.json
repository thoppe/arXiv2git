  "README": "!   We use 'gmake' options in our Makefiles. If you do not have 'gmake' \n!   then more likely your  'make'  is identical to 'gmake'.\n\n\nI. General  installation.\n   Launch\n       [g]make \n\n   It should generate files with compilers flags\n       CalcHEP_src/FlagsForMake\n       CalcHEP_src/FlagsForSh\n   \n   and  compile  \n       CalcHEP_src/bin/s_calchep \n       sources/micromegas.a\n\n   Possible problems are discussed in Section VII below. \n\n   micromegas_3.1 was tested for  Linux, and  Darwin\n \nII. To work with MSSM, NMSSM, CPVMSSM, IDM, LHM, RHNM, SM4, Z3M  models\n    go to the corresponding directory. \n\n    To generate an executable use\n     [g]make main=<source file>\n                                                          \n    <source file> is expected to be a C  (.c) file, C++ (.cpp) one,\n     or a Fortran (.F) file.\n\n    The list of functions you can use in  your programs are described in man/man.pdf as well as\n    hep-ph/0405253, hep-ph/0607059, arXiv:0803.2360[hep-ph], arXiv:1005.4133[hep-ph] and arXiv:1305.0237[hep-ph].\n\n *** For Cygwin, launch an executable with \n    ../cgwRun <exe with parameters>\n\nIII. Each model directory  contains at least 2 sample  files: \n      main.c \n      main.F\n      a sample for C++  can be obtained by 'cp main.c main.cpp'\n \n     main.c and main.F  contain  several independent modules \n     which can be switched ON  by '#define' preprocessor instructions\n     at the top of the file.\n\n     The modules are:\n\n   a) MASSES_INFO\n       displays mass spectrum for odd particles (super partners) and \n       Higgs particles as well as Higgs widths;\n   b) CONSTRAINTS\n       checks experimental  constraints;  \n   c) HIGGSBOUNDS\n\tcalls HiggsBounds to constrain the Higgs sector;\n   d) OMEGA\n       computes the relic density;\n   e) INDIRECT_DETECTION\n       calculates the WIMP annihilation spectra and integrates\n       over the halo profile;\n   f) RESET_FORMFACTORS\n       resets parameters of nucleon form factors, DM velocity \n       distribution, and nucleus Fermi density;\n   g) CDM_NUCLEON\n       calculates WIMP-nucleon elastic scattering amplitudes;\n   h) CDM_NUCLEUS\n       calculates the number of events for 1day&1kg  of detector material and \n       recoil energy distribution for WINP-nuclei reaction;\n   i) NEUTRINO\n\tcomputes the neutrino flux from DM captured in the Sun/Earth and \n\tthe corresponding muon flux;\n   j) DECAYS\n\tcomputes the decay widths and branching ratios for any particle;\n   k) CROSS_SECTIONS\n       calculates cross sections for any 2->2 process\n   l) CLEAN\n\tcleans intermediate files\n\nIV. Each model directory contains a subdirectory  'calchep/' intended \n    for calculation of different cross sections and decay widths \n    in  interactive sessions  for SM and other models.  \n        \nV.To implement a new model, launch \n    ./newProject  <project name>\n      \n Then the directory <project name> will be created with all needed subdirectories \n and  sample  files inside. Further instructions can be found in the local \n README file. \n      \nVI. To clean all generated files use \n   [g]make clean \n      or  \n   ./clean \n   launched from micromegas_3.X directory. In each model directory you \n   can call \n     [g]make clean \n   to remove all generated files in this particular directory.\n\nVII. Compilers and  their Flags\n    Options for compilation are stored in the file \n       CalcHEP_src/FlagsForSh   \n    If this files does not exist, it is generated by [g]make according \n    to Unix version. If CalcHEP_src/FlagsForSh exists, [g]make\n    only checks it.  In case of problem with compilers and their flags \n    one can improve CalcHEP_src/FlagsForSh and launch [g]make again.\n    Using \n         [g]make clean \n    you will be asked about an option to save FlagsForSh for the next\n    compilation.  \n        [g]make flags\n    only generates FlagsForSh file. It gives you an option to \n    select the compiler and flags you prefer. \n\n    Special requirements, but not strictly necessary.\n     1) To see graphical plots generated by micrOMEGAS and work with CalcHEP\n        graphical interface,   X11 development package should be installed. \n        One can check that directory   /usr/include/X11  contains *.h files. \n        If not, CalcHEP  will be compiled in 'blind' mode and\n        CalcHEP/FlagsForSh will contain empty definition of LX11 variable. \n          LX11=\"\"\n        The name of package which has to be installed to solve the problem\n        depends on platform\n           libX11-devel     for  Fedora/Scientific, Darwin(MAC)\n           libX11-dev       for  Ubuntu/Debian\n           xorg-x11-devel   for  SUSE\n      2) CalcHEP interactive section needs   'xterm' command.     \n \n\nVIII.
