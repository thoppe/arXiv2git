The complete [original report](http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.7105) is available on arXiv.org, and contains a large amount of additional information on the method we used for forecasting, accuracy assessments, etc.\n\n\n**Citation:**\n\n```bibtex\n@article{beger2016irregular,\n  title={Irregular Leadership Changes in 2014: Forecasts using ensemble, split-population duration models},\n  author={Beger, Andreas and Dorff, Cassy L. and Ward, Michael D.},\n  journal={International Journal of Forecasting},\n  year={2016},\n  volume={32},\n  issue={1},\n  pages={98--111}\n  }    \n```\n\nGetting the code and data\n-----\n\nThe easiest way to get the replication code is to [download a zip](https://github.com/andybega/ijf-ilc2014/archive/master.zip). Alternatively, you can clone the repository through the Github GUI client ([OS X](https://mac.github.com/), [Windows](https://windows.github.com/)).\n\nThe data are available on dataverse: [http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/28942](http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/28942). Several smaller intermediate results are included in the git data folder, but replicating the full analysis will require the larger raw data from dataverse. \n\n\nRunning the replication\n-----\n\n1. [Download](https://github.com/andybega/ijf-ilc2014/archive/master.zip) or [clone](github-mac://openRepo/https://github.com/andybega/ijf-ilc2014) this repository. \n\n2. Download the data sets on [Dataverse](http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/28942), at least the 2 beginning with `irc-data` and place them in `replication/data`.\n\n3. In `runme.R`, change the working directory path on line 33.\n\n4. Source or run the code in `runme.R`. We recommend running through the code block by block rather than sourcing. The original analysis was run on OS X using R 3.0.2 and 3.1.1.\n\nThe script relies on two packages, `EBMAforecastbeta` and `spduration` that are not available on CRAN. They are included in `replication/R/packages` with both OS X and Windows versions. The replication script will attempt to install them if they are not already present, but you may have to do so manually if this fails.\n\nFiles and scripts\n------\n\n`data`\n* `all_preds.rda` - contains all theme/ensemble predictions from 2001 to 2014-09; used throughout `runme.r` to replicate figures in the same order as in the article, even though the models needed to create it are estimated in the same script   \n* `ensemble_data.rda` - calibration/test data to estimate ensemble\n* `irc_data_mod.rda` - imputed data\n* `ensemble.rda` - saved ensemble model object\n* `irc-data-v3.rda` - raw, unimputed source data\n* `model_estimates.rda` - saved estimates for the 7 theme models\n\n`graphics`\n* Contains the graphics used in the article.\n\n`R/packages`\n* `EBMAforecastbeta_0.44.tar.gz` - OS X source package\n* `EBMAforecastbeta_0.44.zip` - Windows source package\n* `spduration_0.12.tar.gz` - OS X source package\n* `spduration_0.12.zip` - Windows source package\n\n`R/utilities`\n* `ensemble_forecast.r` - helper functions to calculate ensemble forecast\n* `gather_preds.r` - gathers all theme/ensemble predictions from 2001 to 2014-09 in one data frame, `all_preds.rda`\n* `theme_models.r` - helper functions for theme model fit\n* `varDecomp.r` - helpfer functions for variable variance decomposition\n* `worldMap.r` - function for choropleth worldmap\n\n\n\n",
