  "README.md": "HMC_GPU\n=======\n\nThis code can be used to replicate the results found in:\n\nBeam, A.L., Ghosh, S.J., Doyle, J. Fast Hamiltonian Monte Carlo Using GPU Computing. \n\nThe preprint can be accessed here:\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4089\n\nTo get started you will need to make sure you have the following depedencies installed:\n\nGPU Computing Environment:\n- Cuda SDK 5.0: https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit\n- CULA (needed by the python scikit below): http://www.culatools.com/\n\nPython Environment\n- Python 2.7: http://www.python.org/\n- Numpy - http://www.numpy.org/\n- SciPy - http://www.scipy.org/\n- PyCuda - http://mathema.tician.de/software/pycuda/\n- CUDA SciKit: http://scikits.appspot.com/cuda\n\nAdditionally, if you would like to run the glmnet comparison, you will need to install the following:\n- R: http://cran.us.r-project.org/\n- glmnet: http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/glmnet/index.html\n- doMC (for parallel processing in R - Linux): http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/doMC/index.html\n- doSNOW (for parallel processing in R - Windows): http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/doSNOW/index.html\n\nEach script is a self-contained file that corresponds to one set of results in the manuscript. The first time you run the\ncode you may recieve some text indicating compiler warnings. This is expected and can be safely ignored.\n\nThe MNIST data used in the maunscript can be found here:\n\nhttp://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/\n",
