It can be used in tree implementations and provides a really fast way of looking up a sorted tree.\n\nRead about rational numbers in tree structures here: http://arxiv.org/pdf/0806.3115v1.pdf\n\nNote: This is NOT a tree implementation, it is only a wrapper of rational numbers in ruby.\n\nFor a proper tree implementation see e.g. [mm-tree](https://github.com/leifcr/mm-tree)\n\n## Installation\n\n### Using bundler\n\nLatest stable release:\n\n```ruby\ngem 'rational_number'\n```\n\nFor latest edge version:\n\n```ruby\ngem 'rational_number', :git => 'https://github.com/leifcr/rational_number.git'\n```\n\nThis gem supports the following versions of ruby\n\n   * ruby 1.9.3\n   * ruby 2.0.0\n   * ruby 2.1.2\n\n### Without bundler\n\ngem install rational_number\n\n## Usage\n\n```ruby\na = RationalNumber.new # Root\nb = a.child_from_position(1) # Get child of root in position 1\nb.next_sibling # Get next sibling of b\nb.sibling_from_position(5) #Get sibling in position 5 on the current \"level\"\n\n# More advanced\nb.rational_number_from_ancestor_and_position(b,5) # Get a specific rational number from a given ancestor and position\n\n# check if rational numbers are related\na.has_child?(b) # true\nb.is_child_of?(root) # true\n\nb.has_ancestor?(a) # true\na.is_ancestor_of?(b) # true\n```\n\nFor more examples see the spec in spec/rational\\_number\\_spec.rb\n\n## Note on Patches/Pull Requests\n\n* Fork the project.\n* Make your feature addition or bug fix.\n* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a future version unintentionally.\n* Send me a pull request, if you have features you like to see implemented.\n\n## Thanks\n\n_Dan Hazel_: For his paper on rational numbers\n\n## Copyright\n\nOriginal ideas are Copyright Jakob Vidmar and Joel Junstrom. Please see their github repositories for details\nCopyright (c) 2013-2014 Leif Ringstad.\nSee LICENSE for details.\n",
