  "README.md": "# CFHTLenS Revisited\n\nThe file cosmicshear.f90 calculates the 2pt shear correlation functions \\xi_+ and \\xi_- accounting for key astrophysical systematics coming from intrinsic galaxy alignments, baryonic effects in the nonlinear matter power spectrum, and photometric redshift uncertainties. The file meadfitsj.f90 includes HMcode as a separate module in CosmoMC for the nonlinear matter power spectrum. These are both compatible with the July-2015 version of CosmoMC. \n\nWe also include updated CFHTLenS cosmic shear tomography measurements, as described in the tarball. \n\nThe measurements and fitting pipeline are presented in http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.05786. The central chains of this paper are available at https://www.dropbox.com/s/l836vce4b63ocgw/centralchains.tar.gz?dl=0. For the original version of HMcode, please see https://github.com/alexander-mead/hmcode.\n\nPlease feel free to contact us at sjoudaki@swin.edu.au if you have any questions.\n",
