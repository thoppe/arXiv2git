Please see the following paper for\r\ninformation on \"dynamical spillover\".\r\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04766\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRequirements\r\n------------\r\n\r\n- Numpy\r\n\r\n- Networkx\r\n\r\n- IPython notebook (for the example)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMain Files\r\n-----------\r\n\r\n- extract_counts.py : This file contains functions that can extract\r\n  counts that can be used to construct a Markov chain from\r\n  longitudinal data on Multiplex networks.\r\n\r\n- MultiplexMarkovChain.py : This file contains the class\r\n  MultiplexMarkovChain. This class helps in building a Markov chain\r\n  that represents edge dynamics of a multiplex network. The class also\r\n  has methods to construct the corresponding null model that can\r\n  determine the existence of dynamical spillover.\r\n\r\n- example.ipynb : An example (in IPython notebook format) that steps\r\n  through how this package can be used to detect dynamical spillover\r\n  in a real world multiplex network. You can see the example by typing\r\n  `ipython notebook` in the command line from the folder in which you\r\n  cloned the ``MultiplexMarkovChain`` repository, then clicking\r\n  `example.ipynb` in the browser window that opens.\r\n\r\n- alliance_trade_nodes.csv : Contains the data on the presence of\r\n  nodes (i.e. nation-states) in each year from 1950 to 2003. The\r\n  format is: year,nation. \r\n\r\n- alliance_trade_edges.csv : Contains the data on the presence of\r\n  alliance and trade edges between a pair of nodes\r\n  (i.e. nation-states) in each year from 1950 to 2003. The format is:\r\n  year,nation1,nation2,alliance,trade. `alliance`, `trade` are binary\r\n  entries with 0 indicating absence and 1 indicating presence of that\r\n  particular type of link between `nation1` and `nation2`.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnittest files\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n- test_MultiplexMarkovChain.py : unittests for the classes in the\r\n  file MultiplexMarkovChain.py.\r\n\r\n- test_extract_counts.py : unittests for functions in the file\r\n  extract_counts.py.\r\n\r\n- test_input_edges.csv : Edge list of an example network used as input\r\n  in unittests.\r\n\r\n- test_input_nodes.csv : Node list of an example network used as input\r\n  in unittests.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nData Sources\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nThe files `alliance_trade_nodes.csv` and `alliance_trade_edges.csv`\r\ntogether describe the multiplex network of alliance and trade between\r\ncountries. The data on international alliances is derived from the\r\nATOP project [B. A. Leeds, Rice University, Department of Political\r\nScience, Houston (2005)]. The trade networks are derived from a\r\ncombination of two datasets on international trade: the Correlates of\r\nWar (COW) bilateral trade dataset [K. Barbieri, O. M. Keshk,\r\nand B. M. Pollins, Conflict Management and Peace Science 26, 471\r\n(2009)], and the Gledistch trade dataset [K. S. Gleditsch, Journal of\r\nConflict Resolution 46, 712 (2002)]. The trade data is binarized such\r\nthat an edge exists if the value of trade between two countries is\r\ngreater than 0.001 of the exporter's GDP. Note the above threshold is\r\nnot symmetric between the two countries involved in trade, and hence\r\ngives us a directed network of trade between nations. Neglecting the\r\nedge directionality, i.e., ensuring there is at least one-way trade\r\nyields the data provided here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments\r\n-----------------\r\n``MultiplexMarkovChain`` thanks Ryan James and Pierre-Andre Noel for helpful\r\npointers. \r\n\r\n\r\n``MultiplexMarkovChain`` gratefully acknowledges support from the following:\r\n\r\n- US Army Research Laboratory and the US Army Research Office under MURI award W911NF-13-1-0340, and Cooperative Agreement W911NF-09-2-0053 \r\n\r\n- The Defense Threat Reduction Agency Basic Research Grant No. HDTRA1-10-1-0088 \r\n\r\n- NSF Grant No. ICES-1216048\r\n",
