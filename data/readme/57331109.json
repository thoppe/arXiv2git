The entire training and validation images are resized to 328x328 pixels and appropriate lmdbs are created.\n\nI am using train_val adapted from https://github.com/soeaver/caffe-model, the actually used train_val file can be found here: https://gist.github.com/revilokeb/ab1809954f69d6d707be0c301947b69e\n\nThe solver aims to be as close as possible to the description in http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261, the one I am currently using can be found here: https://gist.github.com/revilokeb/b6c10197898662ed83832ee871da4528\n\nFor the time being I have set aside 2 12GB GPUs to work in parallel for that experiment. 10 epochs can be trained with that setup in a little less than 5 days. A look at http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.07261 their figure 24 and 26 shows that after around 120 epochs top-1 and top-5 validation error does not seem to improve much further. So with the current setup roughly 60 days of training will be needed before reaching the final accuracy (if everything goes well).\n\nIntermediate snapshots I will put to the following folder for anyone who is interested for download (every 10 epochs): https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1qLpHDbczM2bTZyeHc0TmNoanM. If I am losing my patience along the way others might continue with that experiment :-).\n\nCurrently I am after epoch 10 and validation error and training loss have been developing as follows:\n![Alt text](./inception_resnetv2_10epochs.png?raw=true \"Current Validation Error / Training Loss\")\n\n",
