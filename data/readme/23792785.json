  "README.md": "Accept-reject Markov tree \n================================\n\nThis package fits the Accept-reject Markov tree (ARM-tree) for comparison between probability distributions. \nThe model is based on a nonparametric process taking the form of a Markov model that transitions \nbetween a \"reject\" and a \"accept\" state on a multi-resolution partition tree of the sample space.\nThe ARM-tree effectively detect and characterize a variety of underlying differences. \nThese differences can be visualized using several plotting functions.\n\n### Install\nThe package can be installed on Linux and Mac using `devtools`:\n\n```S\ninstall.packages('devtools')\nlibrary('devtools')\ndevtools::install_github('ARMtree', 'jacsor')\n```\n\n### Use\nThere are five functions in this package, and their descriptions are provided in the help files\n\n```S\nans = ARMT(X, G)\nsummary(ans)\nplot1D(ans)\nplot2D(ans)\nplotTree(ans)\n```\n\n### Reference\nSoriano J. and Ma L.
