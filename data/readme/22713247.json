  "README.md": "AIDA Sentences\n==============\n\nAIDA is a scheme for English sentences. Such sentences are:\n\n- **Atomic:** a sentence describing one thought that cannot be further broken\n  down in a practical way\n- **Independent:** a sentence that can stand on its own, without external\n  references like \"this effect\" or \"we\"\n- **Declarative:** a complete sentence ending with a full stop that could in\n  theory be either true or false\n- **Absolute:** a sentence describing the core of a claim ignoring the\n  (un)certainty about its truth and ignoring how it was discovered (no\n  \"probably\" or \"evaluation showed that\"); typically in present tense\n\n\nPublication\n-----------\n\nSee the following paper for the details:\n\n- Tobias Kuhn, Paolo Emilio Barbano, Mate Levente Nagy, and Michael Krauthammer.\n  Broadening the Scope of Nanopublications. In _Proceedings of the 10th Extended\n  Semantic Web Conference (ESWC)_. Springer, 2013.\n  http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.2446\n\n\nExamples\n--------\n\nA simple example of an AIDA sentence is:\n\n> Malaria is transmitted by moquitoes.\n\nThis is a more specific and more complex example:\n\n> The degree of hepatic reticuloendothelial function impairment does not differ\n> between cirrhotic patients with and without previous history of SBP.\n\n\nURIs\n----\n\nAIDA sentences can be represented by URIs of the following form:\n\n- http://purl.org/aida/Malaria+is+transmitted+by+moquitoes.\n- http://purl.org/aida/The+degree+of+hepatic+reticuloendothelial+function+impairment+does+not+differ+between+cirrhotic+patients+with+and+without+previous+history+of+SBP.\n\n",
