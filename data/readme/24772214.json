  "README.md": "# Louis's Home Page\n\n## About \n\nThis repo is the [Jekyll][jekyll] source to Louis Theran's \nhome page, which is hosted at <http://theran.lt>.\n\n## License\n\nThe code and layouts are derived from Jekyll, and inherit that\nlicense.  There is a [template branch][lttemp] that \nyou should fork if you want to make a similar \nsite.  There are some [directions][quickstart] for how to \ndo that.\n\nAll the actual site content is copyright Louis Theran and \nmay not be used except at the site <http://theran.lt/>.\n\nThe stylesheet here uses the font [Atlas Grotesk][atlas].  This\nis licensed only for <http://theran.lt/>.  You need to buy your own \nlicense if you want to use it.  The [template version][lttemp] of this \nsite has a stylesheet without the fonts.\n\n[jekyll]: http://jekyllrb.com/\n[atlas]: https://commercialtype.com/typefaces/atlas/grotesk\n[lttemp]: https://github.com/theran/theran.github.io/tree/template\n[quickstart]: http://theran.lt/2014/11/12/about-this-site.html\n\n## Documentation\n\nAt the moment, this is somewhat modular, except for the home page at \n`index.html` and the CV and `CV.html` which contain some free text \ninside the Liquid templates.\n\nBelow is a quick guide to some of the features.\n\n### Papers\n\nThese are part of the collection `_papers`.  A typical journal article \nfrontmatter looks like this:\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n---\nlayout: paper\ntype: journal\narxiv: 1008.1837\ndoi: 10.1016/j.aim.2012.10.007\njournal: advances\nauthors:\n    - justin\n    - louis\ntitle: Generic combinatorial rigidity of periodic frameworks\nyear: 2013\nvolume: 233\nissue: 1\npages: 291-331\n---\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThe body is the abstract.  \nSee this site for conferernce and preprint examples.  Authors conferences and journals \nare listed in `_data/authors.yml`, `_data/conferences.yml`, and `_data/journals.yml`.\nThis is enough to automatically generate your bibliography.\n\n### CV\n\nSee `CV.html` for a semi-automated CV generator, that should be somewhat updatable.\n\n### Styling\n\nThis is derived pretty closely from the Jekyll default.  I've tried to make \nthings even a little more modular, but I only noticed how SCSS mixins work\nrecently, so more can be done.",
