  "README.md": "# AZ-Net\n\n## Introduction\nThis github repository is an implementation of the AZ-Net detection method described in \n\"Adaptive Object Detection Using Adjacency and Zoom Prediction\" \n\nCreated by Yongxi Lu at University of California, San Diego.\n\nIf you find this useful, please consider citing\n\n\n  ```\n  @article{lu2015adaptive,\n      title={Adaptive Object Detection Using Adjacency and Zoom Prediction},\n      author={Lu, Yongxi and Javidi, Tara and Lazebnik, Svetlana},\n      journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1512.07711},\n      year={2015}\n    }\n ```\n\n## Installation\n\nTo install, use the following steps:\n\n1. Install Caffe and all its dependencies. Requirements for `Caffe` and `pycaffe` (see: [Caffe installation instructions](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html))\n\n  **Note:** Caffe *must* be built with support for Python layers!\n\n  ```make\n  # In your Makefile.config, make sure to have this line uncommented\n  WITH_PYTHON_LAYER := 1\n  ```\n\n2. Clone the AZ-Net repository. Make sure to use the `--recursive` flag\n\n  ```Shell\n  # Make sure to clone with --recursive\n  git clone --recursive https://github.com/luyongxi/az-net.git\n  ```\n\n3. Build the Cython modules\n\n    ```Shell\n    cd $ROOT/lib\n    make\n    ```\n\n4. Build Caffe and pycaffe\n    ```Shell\n    cd $ROOT/caffe-fast-rcnn\n    # Now follow the Caffe installation instructions here:\n    #   http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html\n\n    # If you're experienced with Caffe and have all of the requirements installed\n    # and your Makefile.config in place, then simply do:\n    make -j8 && make pycaffe\n    ```\n\n5. Fetch ImageNet models\n\n    ```Shell\n    cd $ROOT\n    ./data/scripts/fetch_imagenet_models.sh\n    ```\n    \n    See `data/README.md` for details.\n\n6. To train and test models, use scripts in \n  \n    ```\n    $ROOT/experiments/scripts\n    ```\n",
