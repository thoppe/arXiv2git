  "README.md": "# lstm_real_book\n\nA Keras-based source code that uses LSTM to generate jazz chords progression.\n\n### Usage\n1. Clone the repo\n2. Set `character-mode` in `main_lstm_realbook.py` as `True` or `False` to choose between char-rnn and word-rnn.\n3. Run by `$ python main_lstm_realbook.py`\n4. Use [chord_sentences.txt](https://github.com/keunwoochoi/lstm_real_book/blob/master/chord_sentences.txt) to whatever you want\n5. Use [2486 .lab files](https://github.com/keunwoochoi/lstm_real_book/blob/master/more_data_to_play_with/jazz_xlab.zip) to do even more interesting!\n\n### External links\n * More info on [my blog post](https://keunwoochoi.wordpress.com/2016/02/19/lstm-realbook/)\n * Listen to the result in [my soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/kchoi-research/sets/lstm-realbook-1-5)\n * A similar project on Drums: [LSTMetallica repo](https://github.com/keunwoochoi/LSTMetallica), [blog post](https://keunwoochoi.wordpress.com/2016/02/23/lstmetallica/), [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/kchoi-research/sets/lstmetallica-drums)\n\n### Citation\n**Text-based LSTM networks for Automatic Music Composition**, Keunwoo Choi, George Fazekas, Mark Sandler, *1st Conference on Computer Simulation of Musical Creativity*, Huddersfield, UK, 2016 [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.05358#), [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.05358v1)\n",
