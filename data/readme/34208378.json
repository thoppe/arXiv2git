Pandoc uses `longtable`, which IEEEtrans explodes.\nJust put in tables using pure LaTeX.\n\n### figures\n\nThey will work fine if your figure is small and fits in one column. otherwise,\nuse LaTeX.\n\n## usage\n\n### metadata\n\nYou'll want to change `metadata.yaml` to reflect things about your paper, such\nas authors and the title.\n\n### editing\n\nPut all markdown files into `sections/`. I suggest naming them in a sortable\norder, e.g., `01_intro.md`, `02_background.md`, etc. Make sure to include\nsomething like `sections/other.md` as the last file to get a References\nsection.\n\n### compiling the pdf\n\nJust run `make`. Or look at `Makefile` and draw your own conclusions.\n\n### customizing\n\nIf you have some extra packages or LaTeX you want to define, throw it into\n`custom.latex`. It'll be inserted before the document environment begins.\n\n\n### arxiv uploading\n\nYou can upload directly to arxiv after compiling. upload the `paper.tex` and\n`paper.bbl` files along with any figures. I set `graphicspath` in\n`template.latex` to make the figures folder work on arxiv without needing to\nedit stuff, but you can put them wherever suits you in `custom.latex`.\n\n\n## contributing\n\n1.
