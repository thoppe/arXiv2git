  "README.md": "# Non-Perturbative Four-Point Scattering from First-Quantized Relativistic JWKB\n## M.E. Irizarry-Gelpi and W. Siegel\n### Abstract\nWe apply the quantum mechanical (first-quantized) JWKB approximation to a two-body path integral describing the near-forward scattering of two relativistic, heavy, non-identical, scalar particles in *D* spacetime dimensions. In contrast to the loop expansion, in *D = 4* this gives a strong-coupling expansion, and in *D = 3* a non-perturbative weak-coupling expansion. When the interaction is mediated by massless quanta with spin *N*, we obtain explicit, relativistic results for the scattering amplitude when *N = 0*, *1* and *2*. In *D = 4* we find a Regge trajectory function that agrees with the usual quantum mechanical spectrum. We also find an exponentiated infrared divergence that becomes a pure phase factor when the Mandelstam invariants *s* and *t* are inside of the physical scattering region. In *D = 3* we find a singularity whose position along the *s* axis is dependent on *t*. When the interaction is mediated by a heavy scalar with mass *M*, in *D = 3* we find an all-order scattering amplitude where the multi-mass branch points *t = (L + 1)2 M2* appear as Regge poles.\n\nYou can also find this article [on the arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.04450).",
