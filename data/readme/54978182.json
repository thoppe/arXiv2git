This was the reason that for quite a while the only resources available have been\nthe Bitcoin source code, blog/forum/mailing list posts, and other online publications. \nAlso the original Bitcoin [paper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) which initiated the hype was published online without any prior peer-review. \n\nMeanwhile a constant flow of scientific publications can be observed. \nThis leads to an increasing number of available peer-reviewed publications. \nAlthough peer-review is *not* always a guaranty for best quality,\nwe initially distinguish publications in this field into three different\ncategories. The nonnegotiable hard requirement for any category is that the work must be **open-access** and not locked behind pay-walls. \n\n* `blockchain_peerreviewed.bib`\nReferences in this category are peer-reviewed papers which have been published on scientific venues \n(e.g. conferences proceedings, journals, workshops, etc.)\n\n* `blockchain_eprint.bib`\nReferences in this category are preprints/eprints of papers (for example on http://arxiv.org) that have not been published at an peer-reviewed venue (yet).\nThe criteria for a paper/publication in this category is:\n    + based on facts \n    + systematic structure \n    + no marketing\n    + not pure speculation\n    + written in comprehensible English \n\n* `blockchain_online.bib`\nReferences in this category are online resources like for example:  \n    + github projects\n    + block explorer websites\n    + developer references (wiki entries, etc.) \n\nAgain the requirements form above hold:\n    + not purely marketing (some banners on websites are acceptable)\n    + not pure speculation\n    + written in comprehensible English \n\nIn respect to the original *publication spirit* of Bitcoin, we combine all\nreferences into a single blob file called `blockchain.bib` when executing \n`make` in the projects root directory.\n\n\n### Download papers\n\nTo download the papers into the `./papers` folder type:\n```bash\n$ python fetch_pdfs.py ./blockchain_peerreviewed.bib papers/\n```\n\n### Generate html list\n\nTo generate a html paper list you need to clone/install the [bibloograpy](https://github.com/NullHypothesis/bibliograpy) tool by Philipp Winter. \n```bash\n$ git clone https://github.com/NullHypothesis/bibliograpy \n$ cd blockchainbib\n$ bash generate.sh\n```\n\n\n## Related work\nA list of other collections of resources on this topic:\n\n* Jeremy Clacks collection:\n    + http://users.encs.concordia.ca/~clark/biblio.php#bitcoin\n\n* Brett Scott collection (huge):\n    + https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VaWhbAj7hWNdiE73P-W-wrl5a0WNgzjofmZXe0Rh5sg/htmlview?usp=sharing&pli=1&sle=true\n\n* Collection in the Bitcoin wiki (subset of the above)\n    + https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Research\n\n* Collection in the Bitcoinbyte blog (outdated)\n    + https://thebitcoinbyte.wordpress.com/annotated-bibliography/\n\n\n\n## Contribute \n\n### Add/Update an entry in the .bib file\n\n1. Add or update the bib entry in one of the three files: `blockchain_peerreviewed.bib`, `blockchain_eprint.bib` or\n`blockchain_online.bib`. **Note:** that only papers in `blockchain_peerreviewed.bib` are currently exported as `.html` to \n[https://allquantor.at/blockchainbib](https://allquantor.at/blockchainbib). \nThis is not because I am particularly picky about scientific publications, but simply because the papers in the other two `.bib`\nfiles are not yet parsable by `bibliograpy` and I have not yet adapted the code yet.  \nDo not edit the `blockchain.bib` file it will be auto generated when running `make` in the root of the project. \n\n2. Run the `test/Makefile` to see if \neverything works as expected. \n```shell\n$ cd ./test\n$ make \n$ evince bare_jrnl.pdf\n```\n\n## License\n\nBibliography license: CC BY\n[![CC](https://licensebuttons.net/l/by/4.0/88x31.png)](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\n\nPython code and `.tpl` templates license: GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE\n\n## Credits \n\n* All authors that created the publications listed in this bibliography\n* Philipp Winter (phw[at]nymity.ch) for the python fetch code and the `.tpl` templates\n* Aljosha Judmayer (ajudmayer[at]sba-research[dot]org)\n",
