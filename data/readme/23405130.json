In comparison to the algorithm of Karger et al., jump\nconsistent hash requires no storage, is faster, and does a better job of evenly dividing the key\nspace among the buckets and of evenly dividing the workload when the number of buckets\nchanges. Its main limitation is that the buckets must be numbered sequentially, which makes it\nmore suitable for data storage applications than for distributed web caching.\n\n# Usage\n\nAdd the dependency to your pom.xml\n\n    <dependency>\n        <groupId>com.github.ssedano</groupId>\n        <artifactId>jump-consistent-hash</artifactId>\n        <version>1.0.0</version>\n    </dependency>\n\nOr download the `jar` from [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cjump-consistent-hash) and add it to your classpath.\n\nClone the repo and build it with maven and add the `jar` to your classpath.\n\n    $ git clone https://github.com/ssedano/jump-consistent-hash\n    $ cd jump-consistent-hash\n    $ mvn clean install\n\nOr copy the class and add it to your code base.\n\nThen import it and use it.\n\n    int jumpConsistentHash = JumpConsistentHash.jumpConsistenHash(key, buckets);\n\nAdditional info in the `javadoc`.\n\n# License\n\nLicensed under [Apache 2](http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).\n",
