It implements a\n`network representation <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_theory>`_ based\non `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_\n`DataFrames <http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.DataFrame.html>`_\nand provides methods to construct, partition and plot graphs, to interface with\npopular network packages and more.\n\nIt is based on a new network representation introduced\n`here <http://arxiv.org/abs/1604.00971>`_.\n\n\nQuick Start\n-----------\n\nDeepGraph can be installed via pip from\n`PyPI <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/deepgraph>`_\n\n::\n\n   $ pip install deepgraph\n\nor if you're using `Conda <http://conda.pydata.org/docs/>`_,\ninstall with\n\n::\n\n   $ conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/deepgraph deepgraph\n\nThen, import and get started with::\n\n   >>> import deepgraph as dg\n   >>> help(dg)\n\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nThe official documentation is hosted on readthedocs.org:\nhttp://deepgraph.readthedocs.org\n\nThe documentation provides a good starting point for learning how\nto use the library. Expect the docs to continue to expand as time goes on.\n\n\nCiting DeepGraph\n----------------\n\nPlease acknowledge and cite the use of this software and its authors when\nresults are used in publications or published elsewhere.
