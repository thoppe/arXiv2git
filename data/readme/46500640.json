  "README.md": "3Dfast: 3D Cosmic Shear \n===================================================\n\n3Dfast is open-source software for calculating the 3D harmonic-space \npower spectrum of a spin-2 field. This is developed within the context \nof weak gravitational lensing calculations. \n\nIt was used to generate the 3D cosmic shear power spectra for these papers:\n\n- 3D Cosmic Shear: Cosmology from CFHTLenS http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.6842\n\nDetails fo the code are as follows:\n\n- Language: C\n- Libraries used: CFITSIO, GSL, CLAPACK\n- Other public code used: CAMB\n- Architecture: The code is parallelisable and uses in-code POSIX threads\n\nThe code has the following functionality, it can\n\n- generate 3D cosmic shear power spectra from data\n- create Fisher matrix predictions for cosmic shear surveys\n- search cosmological parameter likelihood using an MCMC metropolis-hastings algorithm\n\nDistribution\n------------\n\nThe current released version of 3dfast is version 1.0.  \n\nAlso, feel free to fork the repository:\n\n    https://github.com/tdk111/3dfast\n\nOr clone the repository with either of the following:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/tdk111/3dfast\n\nSee INSTALL.md for more information.\n\nThe code is licensed under a BSD-style license.  See the file LICENSE for more\ndetails.\n\nKeeping up-to-date with 3dfast\n------------------------------\n\nThere is a Slack Channel here on which questions can be posted\n\n      https://astro-informatics.slack.com\n\nPlease email the address below with questions\n\n      tom.kitching@gmail.com\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nFor installation instructions, please see the file `INSTALL.md` in the main\nrepository directory.\n\n\nGetting started\n---------------\n\n* Install the code as in `INSTALL.md`.\n\n* Download the test data from here https://goo.gl/KToz70\n* To test the installation an example output is provided here https://goo.gl/cS9QLg\n\nReference documentation\n-----------------------\n\nDocumentaiton is currently under construction, however theory and development of the 3D cosmic shear \nmethod can be found in the following papers: \n\n- Kitching et al., 2015, http://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.7052\n- Kitching et al., 2015, http://arxiv.org/pdf/1401.6842.pdf \t\n- Merkel & Schaefer (2013) http://arxiv.org/pdf/1306.6466\n- Grassi & Schaefer (2013) http://arxiv.org/pdf/1303.1024\n- Kitching, Heavens, Miller (2010) http://arxiv.org/pdf/1007.2953.pdf \n- Camera et al.

Below is a guide to their\ncontents:\n\n* bin/ :      executables (after the compilation procedure is done).\n* include/ :  the .h header files for the C parts of 3dfast.\n* src/ :      the source code for the purely C++ parts of 3dfast.\n* products/ : will contain FITS output from the data vector code, used in the theory code\n* data/ :     contains input data in form of ascii file\n\n",
