  "description": "An R package for sparse PCA via Fantope Projection and Selection", 
  "README.md": "Fantope Projection & Selection\n==============================\n\n`fps` is an R package that provides an implementation of an ADMM algorithm for computing the \nFantope projection and selection estimator.  Most of the package is written in \nC++ using [Rcpp](http://www.rcpp.org) and the [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net) C++ library. The estimator is based on \na convex relaxation of the sparse PCA problem based on the convex hull \nprojection matrices (the Fantope).  This circumvents orthogonality and \ndeflation issues that plague previous approaches to sparse PCA.  A \npreliminary report describing this estimator and some of its near-optimal \nstatistical properties estimator can found in the \n[NIPS conference proceedings](http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5136-fantope-projection-and-selection-a-near-optimal-convex-relaxation-of-sparse-pca). A longer report with more details and new \nresults is forthcoming and will be posted to [arXiv](http://arxiv.org).\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nUse [devtools](https://github.com/hadley/devtools) to install directly from GitHub:\n\n```R\nlibrary(devtools)\ninstall_github(\"fps\", \"vqv\")\n```\n\nExample Usage\n-------------\n\n```R\nlibrary(fps)\ndata(wine)\nout <- fps(cor(wine), ndim = 2)\nplot(out)\n\n# Extract basis coefficients for a particular solution\nv <- coef(out, lambda = 0.5) \nprint(v)\n```\n\nor\n\n```R\nlibrary(fps)\nexample(fps)\n```\n\nIssues\n------\n\n1. This package is currently under development and has not been thoroughly tested.\n2. The documentation is under development and minimal.\n3. The author has only built the package on Mac OS X 10.9.\n",
