It contains three folders for organization:\n1) air_sim\n2) frac_sim\n3) viz_util\n\nThe first folder should reproduce the simulations of air travel, it contains four files:\nrunairparamscan.m, which is a wrapper for running air_paramscan23.m; airflight_input.m contains input parameters and loads input files that are constant for the entire parameter scan; airflight_diffusion.m contains the core machinery for solving the transport.\n\nThe second folder should reproduce the simulations of fractional diffusion, it contains five files:\nrunfracparamscan.m, which is a wrapper for frac_paramscan.m; fracflight_input.m holds parameters that are constant during the parameter scan; fracflight_diffusion.m, which has the machinery for solving the fractional diffusion equation using frac_kernel.m\n\nThe third folder contains data for the air travel networks, including some pre-processing methods for that data. Visualizations are also possible with the post-processing methods here. This folder also has the propensity.m file with disease dynamics used in the Gillespie simulations. A Google Flu spreadsheet for state-by-state historical ILI trends is also included. Of course this data is quite rough but sufficient for our purposes.\n",
