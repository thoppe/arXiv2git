  "README": "Jamon: An Implementation of Constrained Hamiltonian Monte Carlo\nA suite of classes facilitating generalized Hamiltonian \nMonte Carlo (both constrained and unconstrainted).\nFor details see http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.4118 \n\nbaseHamiltonian defines the interface for the\ntarget distribution, in particular the kinetic\nenergy, the potential energy, the evolution\nof the position and momentum, and any constraints.\nchainBundle provides a container of baseHamiltonians,\nincluding the functionality to perform HMC transitions,\ndiagnose convergence, and analyse samples.\n\nSpecifically, the code implements Hamiltonians defined\non Euclidean and Riemannian manifolds (i.e. with\nkinetic energies given by quadratic forms):\n\n    - constMetric (Euclidean Metrics)\n        - diagConstMetric  (Diagonal)\n        - denseConstMetric (Dense)\n\n    - dynamMetric (Riemannian Metrics)\n\n        - denseFisherMetric (Dense Fisher-Rao)\n        - softAbsMetric (Dense SoftAbs)\n\n            - Approximations to the SoftAbs Metric\n                - diagSoftAbsMetric (Diagonal)\n                - outerSoftAbsMetric (Outer-Product)\n                - diagOuterSoftAbsMetric (Diagonal Outer-Product)\n\nExample implementations include a multivariate Gaussian\nand Neal's \"funnel\" distribution.\n\n\nMatrix operations are performed with the Eigen\ntemplate library: http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/\n\nRandom number generation is handled with the\nrandomlib library: http://randomlib.sourceforge.net/\n\nOption plotting available with gnuplot:\nhttp://www.gnuplot.info/\n\nCopyright Michael Betancourt 2012\nbetanalpha@gmail.com\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a \ncopy of this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), \nto deal in the Software without restriction, including without limitation \nthe rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, \nand/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the \nSoftware is furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be \nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, \nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES \nOF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT. \nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, \nDAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT OR \nOTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE \nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\n",
