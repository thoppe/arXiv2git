It consists of three algorithms:\nBWA-backtrack, BWA-SW and BWA-MEM. The first algorithm is designed for Illumina\nsequence reads up to 100bp, while the rest two for longer sequences ranged from\n70bp to 1Mbp. BWA-MEM and BWA-SW share similar features such as the support of\nlong reads and chimeric alignment, but BWA-MEM, which is the latest, is\ngenerally recommended for high-quality queries as it is faster and more\naccurate. BWA-MEM also has better performance than BWA-backtrack for 70-100bp\nIllumina reads.\n\nFor all the algorithms, BWA first needs to construct the FM-index for the\nreference genome (the **index** command). Alignment algorithms are invoked with\ndifferent sub-commands: **aln/samse/sampe** for BWA-backtrack,\n**bwasw** for BWA-SW and **mem** for the BWA-MEM algorithm.\n\n###Availability\n\nBWA is released under [GPLv3][1]. The latest souce code is [freely\navailable][2] at github. Released packages can [be downloaded ][3] at\nSourceForge. After you acquire the source code, simply use `make` to compile\nand copy the single executable `bwa` to the destination you want. The only\ndependency of BWA is [zlib][14].\n\n###Seeking helps\n\nThe detailed usage is described in the man page available together with the\nsource code. You can use `man ./bwa.1` to view the man page in a terminal. The\n[HTML version][4] of the man page can be found at the [BWA website][5]. If you\nhave questions about BWA, you may [sign up the mailing list][6] and then send\nthe questions to [bio-bwa-help@sourceforge.net][7]. You may also ask questions\nin forums such as [BioStar][8] and [SEQanswers][9].\n\n###Citing BWA\n\n* Li H. and Durbin R.
