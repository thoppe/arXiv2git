  "description": "R package to compare the TLW to a CCRW", 
  "README.md": "Source code for a R package that fits and the seven models presented in Auger-Methe, M., A.E. Derocher, M.J. Plank, E.A. Codling, M.A. Lewis (2015-In Press) Differentiating the Levy walk from a composite correlated random walk. Methods in Ecology and Evolution. Preprint available at http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4355\n\nThe main goal of the package is to compare the CCRW to the TLW. The package also allows to simulate some of these models. The files in the folder Simulations are R files to reproduce the simulations described in the manuscript. Note that since the manuscript publication, I've added additional functions. If you want to reproduce the method in the manuscript see version 1: https://github.com/MarieAugerMethe/CCRWvsLW/tree/v1.0.\n\nTo be able to use the package you need to build it from this source code. If unfamiliar with compiling code, I recommend using RStudio (http://www.rstudio.com/). See the information found on RStudio support website to get help on how to build a package with Rstudio: https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486488-Developing-Packages-with-RStudio. Depending on your operating system you will need compilers, for more information see: https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200486498-Package-Development-Prerequisites\n\nYou can also use devtools to install the package:\n> install_github('MarieAugerMethe/CCRWvsLW')\n",
