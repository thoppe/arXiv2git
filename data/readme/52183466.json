You can find further details about how we apply the methods in this repo to analyze mm-scale brain volumes in the following paper:\n\n__Dyer, Eva L., et al. \"Quantifying mesoscale neuroanatomy using X-ray microtomography.\" arXiv preprint, [arXiv:1604.03629](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.03629) (2016).__\n\nIf you use any of the code or datasets in this repo, please cite this paper. \nPlease direct any questions to Eva Dyer at edyer{at}northwestern{dot}edu.\n***\n\n### What's here... ###\n\n* __Code__: MATLAB and Python code for running various segmentation and analysis routines.\n* __Data__: Training and test volumes used to optimize and evaluate our methods.\n* __Library__: Ilastik classifier files + LONI Pipeline files used to execute our distributed workflow on full data volumes (~100 GB of raw data).\n* __Results__: Some results from running xbrain on large datasets.\n",
