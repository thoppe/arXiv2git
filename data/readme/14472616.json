  "README.md": "# Machine Learming benchmarks\n\nAiming to thouroughly benchmark and compare ML algorithms (with current focus on HTM), be designing specialized synthetic datasets that stress a single feature and can be well evaluated and understood. \n\nFor users being able to decide where each algorithm has its strong/weak-spots and decide in application for real-world problems. \n\nThis can also work as a benchmark to evaluate development impact in changes to the algorithms. \n\n![Zoom of anomaly results on data loss benchmark.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/breznak/neural.benchmark/doc_goals/data/datasets/synthetic/anomalySection/dataLoss/results/zoom_results.png)\n\n## Goals of this project\n\nThis repository should be a collection of\n* datasets\n * real-world\n * synthetic\n* papers\n* algorithm implementations\n * (initially) focus on HTM from [NuPIC](https://github.com/numenta/nupic), gladly include any other algorithms/results.\n* results\n * as CSV, image, ...\n* collection of ideas in the Issues\n\n### Current state\n\n- [x] Anomalies classified in independent, significant categories -> [anomaly categorization](https://github.com/breznak/neural.benchmark/issues/2)\n- [x] create synthetic benchmars/datasets for the anomaly categories:\n - [x] point anomalies\n - [x] interval/section anomalies\n - [x] \"higher\" trend (low freq. modulation) anomalies\n - [ ] [additional](https://github.com/breznak/neural.benchmark/labels/dataset)\n- [x] HTM benchmars on the above datasets\n - [ ] Discussion of the results & suggested improvements\n - [ ] Comparison with other well known ML approaches\n\n### Research interest\n\nThe topics of research interest are classified in Issue's labels, and are related to: [NuPIC](https://github.com/breznak/neural.benchmark/labels/nupic), [dataset creation](https://github.com/breznak/neural.benchmark/labels/dataset), [novel research ideas](https://github.com/breznak/neural.benchmark/labels/research), [cognitive modeling](https://github.com/breznak/neural.benchmark/labels/cognitive), and so on...\n\n\n## How do I use/work with this repo?\n\n* You can browse CSV and images in `data/datasets/*/results/` folders.\n* To modify or regenerate new datasets, go to `datasets/generatingScripts/MAIN.m`, you'll need Matlab/R for that.\n* To rerun (HTM/NuPIC) models, `python opf/anomaly_benchmark.py` NuPIC has to be installed.\n* For visualizing data, use `plotResutls/plotDatasets.m` or interactive tool [nupic.visualizations](https://github.com/nupic-community/nupic.visualizations), which can be run [online](https://nupic-visualizations.firebaseapp.com/)\n\n\n## Results\n\n* Evaluation results on benchmarks are located in `results/` subfolders under respective paths and presented in form of CSV and image data. \n* See Hypotheses for ongoing results. \n* Ideas & findings from our work:\n - [x] Importance of noise/\"non-integer f/fs sampling problem\" for ease of learning and quality of abstraction in (artificial) benchmarks.\n - [x] NuPIC: `AdaptiveScalar` encoder is NOT suitable for streaming data, use `RDSE` instead. \n  - [x] How to compute `optimal resulution` for RDSE\n - [x] NuPIC: `Boosting` implementation is causing artificial disturbances in the predictions (and can be improved, or should be turned off)\n - NuPIC:\n  - [x] good on `point` anomaly\n  - [x] good on `interval` anomaly\n\n### Open-research & hypothesis \n\nWarning: anything here may, or may not be true. It is under evaluation. We are raising the topics here to get your focus on the current issues and possible findings. \n\n- [ ] NuPIC: `AnomalyLikelihood` implementation is inferior to the \"raw\" `Anomaly`, esp. with combination of noisy data that distort the internal distribution model. \n- [ ] Impact of parameter optimization (`swarming`) on NuPIC's performance\n- [ ] NuPIC: failing to abstract on `trend` data?\n\n## Sources\n\n1.\tHierarchical Temporal Memory, Numenta.
