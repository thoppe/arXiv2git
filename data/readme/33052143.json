  "README.md": "# kaggle_retinopathy_starter.torch\nA starter kit in Torch for Kaggle Diabetic Retinopathy Detection.\nIt showcases:\n- Classification\n- Regression\n \nDID NOT FINISH IMPLEMENTING:\n- Metric Learning (Siamese and triplet networks)\n- Averaging model ensembles\n\n## What else?\n- 1-GPU or multi-GPU convolution neural networks\n- multi-threaded data loading (data is loaded in compressed-form into memory and decompressed + jittered on the fly)\n- test script to take your trained model (or models) and produce Kaggle-compatible CSV file ready for upload\n\n## Getting started\n- Install torch + dependencies, instructions are here: [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md)\n- If you already have torch installed, update it and it's packages. These scripts use some recently added features.\n\n- Run script with:\n```\nth main.lua\n```\n\n##Ideas to try\n- Maxout Networks: http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.4389\n- All Convolution Net: http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6806\n- Separable Convolution filters\n- Dropout/DropConnect\n- PReLU: https://github.com/torch/nn/blob/master/doc/transfer.md#prelu\n- Batch Normalization: https://github.com/torch/nn/blob/master/doc/simple.md#batchnormalization\n- L2 Pooling: https://github.com/torch/nn/blob/master/SpatialLPPooling.lua\n- Different data augmentation\n- Polar/Log-polar images: https://github.com/torch/image#res-imagepolardst-src-interpolation-mode\n- Different color spaces: https://github.com/torch/image#color-space-conversions\n- All of Sander Deileman's tricks:\n  - http://benanne.github.io/2014/04/05/galaxy-zoo.html\n  - http://benanne.github.io/2015/03/17/plankton.html\n\n##Broad Strategy\n- Train several models\n- Average the network predictions over many of these models\n- For each image, average the prediction over several crops and orientations of the image (for example at test time, every image's prediction is the average of 4 rotations of the image)\n- Win\n",
