Various programs were written\nin Ruby and C (MS VC++ with MPIR and Linux with GMP). The method\nand results are described in the paper \"On the High Water Mark Convergents of Champernowne's Constant\nin Base Ten\", http://arxiv.org/abs/1210.1263.\n\nThe calculation method, programs, and data have been updated and generalized to various bases and the\nresults are described in the paper \"Analysis of the High Water Mark Convergents of Champernowne's \nConstant in Various Bases\", http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.0261.\n\nThe updated programs and data may be accessed at \nhttps://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B2oQudZQvHfSZ1hZN2VIYmU5eTQ&usp=sharing.\nThe readme files should be helpful for building and running the programs with MS VC++ and MPIR,\nand GMP on Linux. USE OF THESE FILES IS RECOMMENDED RATHER THAN THE FILES IN THE CURRENT LOCATION \n(GMP function call error checking has been added, etc.).\n\nThe updated programs and data do not include the base 10 (or any other base) 2nd Generation HWM data\n(see the acticles). If a user is interested in this data, it must be downloaded from the current location.\n",
