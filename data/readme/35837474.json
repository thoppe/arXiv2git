See `LICENSE.md`.\n\n## Installation\n\nOpen a Julia prompt and call: `Pkg.clone(\"https://github.com/mrtzh/Ladder.jl.git\")`\n\n## Background\n\nSee this [blog post](http://blog.mrtz.org/2015/03/09/competition.html) for a discussion on the problem of overfitting to the public leaderboard in a data science competition.\n\nThis is the code repository for [this paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04585). Here's a bibtex reference:\n```\n@article{BH15,\n  author    = {Avrim Blum and Moritz Hardt},\n  title     = {The Ladder: {A} Reliable Leaderboard for Machine Learning Competitions},\n  journal   = {CoRR},\n  volume    = {abs/1502.04585},\n  year      = {2015},\n  url       = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04585},\n  timestamp = {Mon, 02 Mar 2015 14:17:34 +0100},\n  biburl    = {http://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/bib/journals/corr/BlumH15},\n  bibsource = {dblp computer science bibliography, http://dblp.org}\n}\n```\nIf you use the code, we encourage you to cite our paper.\n\n## Examples\n\nThe basic usage is as follows:\n```\nusing Ladder\n# these are the labels corresponding to your holdout data set\nholdoutlabels = [1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.0]\n# create ladder instance around holdout labels\nl = ladder(holdoutlabels)\n# create submission\nsubmission1 = Submission(\"sub1\",\"teamA\",[0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0])\nscore!(l,submission1,Ladder.loss01) # returns: 0.6666666666666666\n# create another submission\nsubmission2 = Submission(\"sub2\",\"teamA\",[1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0])\nscore!(l,submission2,Ladder.loss01) # returns: 0.6666666666666666\n# Ladder judged that there was no significant improvement\n# create another submission\nsubmission3 = Submission(\"sub3\",\"teamA\",[1.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0])\nscore!(l,submission2,Ladder.loss01) # 0.3333333333333333\n```\nSee `examples/photo.jl` for a comprehensive example on Kaggle's Photo Quality Prediction challenge. The data set is not yet available, but will most likely be released by Kaggle in the near future.\n\n## Other usage\n\nYou can also use the Ladder mechanism to keep track of your own progress in a data science project and avoid overfitting to your holdout set. This can be useful in situations where you repeatedly evaluate candidate models against a holdout set.\n",
