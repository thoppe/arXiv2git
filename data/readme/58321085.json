  "README.md": "### Summary\n\nThe _micompr_ [R] package implements a procedure for comparing multivariate\nsamples associated with different groups. The procedure uses principal component\nanalysis to convert multivariate observations into a set of linearly\nuncorrelated statistical measures, which are then compared using a number of\nstatistical methods. This technique is independent of the distributional\nproperties of samples and automatically selects features that best explain their\ndifferences, avoiding manual selection of specific points or summary statistics.\nThe procedure is appropriate for comparing samples of time series, images,\nspectrometric measures or similar multivariate observations.\n\n### How to install\n\nInstall the development version from GitHub with the following command (requires\nthe [devtools] package):\n\n```R\ndevtools::install_github(\"fakenmc/micompr\")\n```\nThe package has been submitted to [CRAN] and, if accepted, will be installable\nvia the following instruction:\n\n```R\ninstall.packages(\"micompr\")\n```\n\n### Documentation\n\nAll methods and functions are fully documented and can be queried using the\nbuilt-in help system. After installation, to access the man pages, invoke the\n_micompr_ help page as follows:\n\n```R\nhelp(\"micompr\")\n```\n\nAdditionally, the package contains two vignettes with a number of examples.\n\n### References\n\n#### Practice\n\n* Fachada N, Rodrigues J, Lopes VV, Martins RC, Rosa AC.
