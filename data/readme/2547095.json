  "README": "===================\n 3DEX version 1.0\n===================\nPaper : http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3591\n\n3DEX is a Fortran/CXX package providing programs and functions \nto perform fast Fourier-Bessel decomposition of 3D fields.\n\nIt is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but without\nany warranty. See the CeCILL License for more details.\n\nPlease contact the authors if you have any question, \ndemand or proposal of new features.\n\nAUTHORS \n-------------------\n Boris Leistedt (boris.leistedt@gmail.com)\n Francois Lanusse (francois.lanusse@gmail.com)\n\nREQUIREMENTS \n-------------------\n Working C, Cxx, MPI and Fortran compilers\n   For example : cc, cxx, mpicxx, gfortran. \n CFITSIO  (export CFITSIO=...)\n BLAS     (export BLAS=...)\n LAPACK   (export LAPACK=...)\n HEALPIX  (export HEALPIX=...)\n\nINSTALLATION - HEALPIX-LIKE\n-------------------\n Please run the ./configure command \n and answer the questions.\n It will edit the 'Makefile'\n Then, run 'make' as usual\n 'make clean' to delete .o files\n 'make tidy' and 'make distclean' to uninstall\n \nINSTALLATION WITH CMAKE\n-------------------\n  Make sure you have exported the variables\n  CFITSIO, BLAS, LAPACK and HEALPIX in your PATH.\n  Then just run the script './CMakeInstall'\n  In case you want to clean, the Makefile is located\n  in the build/ directory ('make clean', 'make tidy').\n\nNOTE\n-------------------\n  3DEX is under CeCILL license, and any user must cite \n  the source and the ArXiV paper http://arxiv.org/abs/1111.3591.\n  The library architecture and the installation scripts\n  are directly inspired by the HEALPix package, \n  which is under GPL License.\n\nRECOMMENDATIONS FOR USE\n-------------------\n\n\nAVAILABLE FEATURES\n-------------------\n > survey2almn\n    Fourier-Bessel decomposition from a raw survey/sample (normal mode)\n    Test: \n    bin/survey2almn res/2mrs30.out out/almn.fits out/cln.fits 20 20 256 2000.0\n    \n > survey2almn_lm\n    Fourier-Bessel decomposition from a raw survey/sample (slower, but low-memory requirements.
