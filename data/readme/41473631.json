  "README.md": "# TurkerGaze\nTurkerGaze: Crowdsourcing Saliency with Webcam based Eye Tracking\n\nCreated by Pingmei Xu, Jianxiong Xiao at Princeton Vision Group.\n\n\n### Introduction\nTurkerGaze is a webcam-based eye tracking game for collecting large-scale eye tracking data via crowdourcing. It is implemented in javascript and the details were described in an [arXiv tech report](http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.06755).\n\n![system overview](http://isun.cs.princeton.edu/TurkerGaze/demo/system_overview.png)\n\n### Citing\nIf you find TurkerGaze useful in your research, please consider citing:\n\n    @article{xu15arXiv,\n        Author = {Pingmei Xu, Krista A Ehinger, Yinda Zhang, Adam Finkelstein, Sanjeev R. Kulkarni, Jianxiong Xiao},\n        Title = {Rich feature hierarchies for accurate object detection and semantic segmentation},\n        Booktitle = {arXiv:1504.06755},\n        Year = {2015}\n    }\n\n### Usage\n\n0. See a demo\n\t0. Setup a local web server, download the folder, open 'pugazetrackr.html' to run the eye tracking task. Save the result data to a local file and visualize the result by 'visualizer.html'.\n\t0. You can also try it here:\n\t[eye tracking task](http://isun.cs.princeton.edu/TurkerGaze/pugazetrackr.html)\n\t[visualization](http://isun.cs.princeton.edu/TurkerGaze/visualizer.html)\n\n\n0. User your own images\n\t0. Create a .json object with two fields: 'gaze' and 'memory' like './demo/imglist.json'. 'gaze' contains the images that you want to present for free-viewing, and 'memory' contains images for the memory test.\n\t0. Pass the path of this .json file by url parameter 'imglist'. For example, http://isun.cs.princeton.edu/TurkerGaze/pugazetrackr.html?imglist=your_imglist_url\n\t0. Run the task!\n\n\n### License\nTurkerGaze is released under the MIT License (refer to the LICENSE file for details).\n\n\n",
