  "README": "corrfitter\n----------\n\nThis directory contains code for manipulating correlators and other Monte\nCarlo 'data' (eg, as in lattice QCD). The main module is:\n\ncorrfitter.py - Defines class CorrFitter for fitting the t dependence of \n\t\t2 and 3 point correlators, described by Corr2 and Corr3 respectively.\n\t\nInformation on how to install the library is in the file INSTALLATION.\n\nDocumentation on how to use this module is in doc/html/index.html (html\nversion, which is the better one) and doc/corrfitter.pdf (pdf version, for \nprinting).\n\nTo test the module try 'make tests'. \n\nThe .py files in directory examples/ illustrate how to use corrfitter. See\nthe file examples/README for more information.\n\nThis module requires the lsqfit and gvar python packages.\n\nBackground information on the some of the fitting strategies used by\ncorrfitter can be found by doing a web searches for \"hep-lat/0110175\",\n\"arXiv:1111.1363\", and :arXiv:1406.2279\" (appendix). These are papers by \nG.P. Lepage and collaborators whose published versions are: G.P. Lepage et al, \nNucl.Phys.Proc.Suppl. 106 (2002) 12-20; K. Hornbostel et al, \nPhys.Rev. D85 (2012) 031504; and ...\n\nVersioning: Version numbers for corrfitter are now (v4.0 and later) based upon\n*semantic  versioning* (http://semver.org). Incompatible changes will be\nsignaled by incrementing the major version number, where version numbers have\nthe form major.minor.patch. The minor number signals new features, and  the\npatch number bug fixes.\n\nCreated by G. Peter Lepage (Cornell University) on 2008-02-12.\nCopyright (c) 2008-14 G. Peter Lepage. \n",
