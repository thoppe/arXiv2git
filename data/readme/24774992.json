  "README.md": "## DeepPyramid\n\nDeepPyramid is a simple toolkit for building feature pyramids from deep convolutional networks.\nThe DeepPyramid data structure is nearly identical to the HOG feature pyramid created by the featpyramid.m function in the [voc-dpm](https://github.com/rbgirshick/voc-dpm) code.\n\n### References\n\nThis code was used in our [tech report](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.5403v2.pdf) about the relationship between deformable part models and convolutional networks.\n\n    @article{girshick14dpdpm,\n        author    = {Ross Girshick and Forrest Iandola and Trevor Darrell and Jitendra Malik},\n        title     = {Deformable Part Models are Convolutional Neural Networks},\n        journal   = {CoRR},\n        year      = {2014},\n        volume    = {abs/1409.5403},\n        url       = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5403},\n        year      = {2014}\n    }\n\n\n### Installation\n\n0. **Prerequisites** \n  0. MATLAB (tested with 2014a on 64-bit Linux)\n  0. Caffe's [prerequisites](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html#prequequisites)\n0. **Install Caffe** (this is the most complicated part)\n  0. Follow the [Caffe installation instructions](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html)\n  0. Let's call the place where you installed caffe `$CAFFE_ROOT` (you can run `export CAFFE_ROOT=$(pwd)`)\n  0. **Important:** Make sure to compile the Caffe MATLAB wrapper, which is not built by default: `make matcaffe`\n  0. **Important:** Make sure to run `cd $CAFFE_ROOT/data/ilsvrc12 && ./get_ilsvrc_aux.sh` to download the ImageNet image mean\n  0. DeepPyramid has been tested with master and dev at the time of this writing\n0. **Get DeepPyramid**\n  0. `git clone https://github.com/rbgirshick/DeepPyramid.git`\n  0. If you haven't installed R-CNN, you'll need to download its [models](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~rbg/r-cnn-release1-data.tgz)\n  1. Copy R-CNN's non-finetuned ImageNet network `<rcnnpath>/data/caffe_nets/ilsvrc_2012_train_iter_310k` to `<deeppyramidpath>/data/caffe_nets/ilsvrc_2012_train_iter_310k` (or just create a symlink).\n\n### Usage\n\n1. Run matlab from inside the DeepPyramid code directory\n2. Add the `matcaffe` mex function to your path (`addpath /path/to/caffe/matlab/caffe`)\n3. Run the demo `demo_deep_pyramid`\n\n### Uses\n\nDeepPyramid can be used for implementing DPMs on deep convolutional network features, rather than HOG features. It can also be used whenever you need a dense multiscale pyramid of image features.\n\n### Caveats\n\nThe implementation is designed to be simple and as a result is very inefficient. There are a variety of ways to speed it up, and they will be done in the future. For now, it takes about 0.5 to 0.6 seconds to compute a feature pyramid on an NVIDIA Titan GPU, which is acceptable.\n",
