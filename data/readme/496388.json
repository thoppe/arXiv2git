  "README": "Mathkaba\nA bibliography manager for mathematicians.\n\nThis program is aimed at managing a collection of mathematical articles.\nTo use it, you should have a hierarchy of directories containing\n.zb files with a copy of a ZentralBlatt entry (in ASCII format).\n\nFields arxiv, doi, and url can be added to the .zb file in order\nto remember the arxiv identifier, the DOI (Digital Object Identifier)\nor an URL where the document can be found: these fields allow the program\nto give easy access to the file.\n\nThe new Zentralblatt 2010 syntax includes a li field which can be used\nto hold links to electronic articles: it should contain tokens like\n\"doi:***\" or \"arxiv:***\".\n\nYou should have PDF of DjVu files along with the .zb files: if GTK 2.14\nor later is available, standard mechanisms will be used to select\nan appropriate viewer, if not, xdg-open will be used, if available.\n\nBy calling\n  mathkaba -d <path>\nMathkaba will explore the directory <path> in search of bibliography\nentries and display them as a list. It also displays a tree representing\nall MSC (Mathematical Subject Classification) tags appearing in the\n.zb files, and allows selective display of articles matching a given\nclassification.\n\nDependencies:\n\n * GTKMM 2.12 or later\n\n * GVFS to be able to open URIs\n",
