  "README.md": "# SubSemi\n\nGAP package for enumerating subsemigroups of semigroup, deciding isomorphisms\nand constructing embeddings. The algorithms assume that the elements of the\nsemigroups can be fully calculated, therefore their applicability is limited\nto relatively small semigroups.\n\nThe original motivation for developing the package was the computational\nenumeration of transformation semigroups up to degree 4. Instructions for\nrecomputing those results can be found in the data/T4 folder. \n\nThe code is highly experimental with no user documentation,\nonly inline comments. The algorithms are described on a\nhigh level in the preprint 'On Enumerating Transformation Semigroups'\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1403.0274\n\nThe enumeration was extended to other diagram semigroups, see the data/SMALLDEGREE folder and the preprint http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.07150 'Finite Diagram Semigroups: Extending the Computational Horizon'. \n\n## Installation\n\nJust copying, or more conveniently cloning, the repository under GAP/pkg/.\n\nCopyright (C) 2014 James East, Attila Egri-Nagy, James D.
