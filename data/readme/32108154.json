  "README.md": "# Row Reordering Java Library\n\nCopyright 2009-2010 Daniel Lemire and Owen Kaser\n\n# PURPOSE\n\nThis is a set of algorithms implemented in Java. The goal of these\nalgorithms is to minimize the number of column runs, to improve\nrun-length encoding compression in database tables.\n\n\n# IS THIS FOR YOU?\n\nThis library is strictly for researchers with a working knowledge of\nJava.\n\n# REFERENCEs\n\nDaniel Lemire and Owen Kaser, Reordering Columns for Smaller Indexes, Information Sciences 181 (12), 2011.\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/0909.1346\n\nDaniel Lemire, Owen Kaser, Eduardo Gutarra, Reordering Rows for Better Compression: Beyond the Lexicographic Order, ACM Transactions on Database Systems 37 (3), 2012.\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1207.2189\n\n\n# USAGE\n\nWe expect CSV input files (comma-separated values). They must be\nfirst transformed into a custom binary format with the flatfiles/CSVtoBinary\nprogram. Then, for example, you can use the flatfiles/Sorting, flatfiles/Shuffle,\nor flatfiles/MultipleLists programs to sort the table in different row orders. \n\n\n# LICENSE\n\nRedistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without modification, are\npermitted provided that the following conditions are met:\n \n    1.
