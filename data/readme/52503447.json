TeX files and PDF files will be uploaded.\n\n1. Linux,Python have been installed.

I have written a program that reaches L2.\n    \n   **2016.3.18 Update**: Just finished name program 2.0 version. This one still stays in L2, but it supports length up to 14 name input.\n\n   -[name_1.0](https://github.com/jamesofey/computationalphysics_N2013301020164/blob/master/name_1.0.py)\n   -[name_2.0](https://github.com/jamesofey/computationalphysics_N2013301020164/blob/master/name_2.0.py)\n4.
