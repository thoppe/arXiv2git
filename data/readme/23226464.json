WHAT IS MADANALYSIS 5 ?\n################################################################################\n\nMadAnalysis 5 is a new framework for phenomenological investigations at particle\ncolliders. Based on a C++ kernel, this program allows to efficiently perform, in\na straightforward and user-friendly fashion, sophisticated physics analyses of\nevent files such as those generated by a large class of Monte Carlo event\ngenerators.\n\nThe first running mode of the program, easier to handle, uses the strengths of a\npowerful Python interface in order to implement physics analyses by means of a\nset of intuitive commands.\n\nThe second running modes requires to implement the analyses in the C++\nprogramming language, directly within the core of the analysis framework. This\nopens unlimited possibilities concerning the level of complexity that can be\nreached, the latter being only limited by the programming skills and the\noriginality of the user.\n\nMore details can be found on the MadAnalysis 5 website:\n  https://launchpad.net/madanalysis5\n\n\n################################################################################\n                             2. REQUIREMENTS\n################################################################################\n\nMadAnalysis 5 requires several external libraries in order to properly run:\n\n - Python 2.6 or a more recent version (but not the 3.X series) that can be\n   downloaded from the website\n     http://www.python.org/\n   In order to check the installed version of Python on a system, it is\n   sufficient to issue in a shell \n     python --version\n\n - The GNU GCC compiler. MadAnalysis 5 has been validated with the versions\n   4.3.X and 4.4.X. The GCC compiler can be downloaded from the website:\n     http://gcc.gnu.org/\n     \n - ROOT v5.27 or a more recent version that can be downloaded from the website\n     http://root.cern.ch/\n   To check the version number of ROOT installed on a system, it is sufficient\n   to type in a shell release \n     root-config --version\n   Moreover, the Python libraries generated by ROOT must be present. To install\n   them, it is necessary to first install the Linux package 'Python-devel' on\n   the system. Next, before generating the ROOT makefile, the ROOT configuration\n   script has to be run as \n     ./configure --with-python\n   Let us note that the Python release employed when starting MadAnalysis 5 has\n   to be the same that has been used for the compilation of ROOT. \n\nTo benefit from all options coming with the MadAnalysis 5 program, the following\n(optional) libraries have to be installed on the system:\n - Zlib headers and libraries that can be downloaded from the website\n     http://zlib.net/\n - The FastJet package version 3.0, or a more recent version, that can be\n   downloaded from\n     http://fastjet.fr/\n   This package can also be installed by typing 'install fastjet' in MadAnalysis\n   5.\n - latex and pdflatex compilers\n\n\n################################################################################\n            3. DOWNLOADING AND INSTALLING THE MADANALYSIS 5 PACKAGE\n################################################################################\n\nThe latest stable version of the MadAnalysis 5 package can be downloaded as a\ntarball from the website\n  https://launchpad.net/madanalysis5\nThe tarball can subsequently be unpacked by issuing in a shell\n  tar -xvf ma5_xxxx.tgz\nwhere 'xxxx' stands for a version number.\n\nAlternatively, MadAnalysis 5 can also be obtained via the Bazaar versioning\nsystem by issuing in a shell\n  bzr branch lp:madanalysis5\n\n################################################################################\n                         4.

VERY FIRST STEPS WITH MADANALYSIS 5\n################################################################################\n\nTo start MadAnalysis 5, it is enough to type in a shell\n  bin/ma5\n\nIn a first step, the program checks all the dependencies and provide warning\nand/or error messages if necessary. Next, the SampleAnalyzer C++ kernel library\nis generated. This is performed once and for all at the first run of MadAnalysis\n5. Let us however note that if the system configuration changes, this is\ndetected by MadAnalysis 5 and the library is regenerated.\n\nIf everything is going as smoothly as it should, a Python command line interface\nwith a 'ma5>' prompt appears. To learn how to use MadAnalysis 5 and to get an\noverview of its functionalities, we refer in particular to Section 3 of the\nmanual that can be found on the webpage\n  http://arxiv.org/abs/1206.1599\n\n\n################################################################################\n                  6. TROUBLESHOOTINGS AND BUG REPORTS\n################################################################################\n\nAny public release of MadAnalysis 5 has been automatically and intensely\nvalidated. However, especially due to the variety of possible system\nconfigurations and the large number of functionalities included in the program,\nit is not impossible that some bugs are found. In this case, is is strongly\nsuggested to create a report on our website\n  https://launchpad.net/madanalysis5\n\nIn this way, you also participate to the improvement of MadAnalysis 5 and the\nauthors thank you for this.\n\n\n################################################################################\n                         7. OUR FAMOUS LAST WORDS\n################################################################################\n\nThe development team of MadAnalysis 5 hopes that the package will meet the\nexpectations of the users and help particle physicists in their phenomenological\ninvestigations.\n\nFeedback, comments and advises are welcome and can be sent by e-mail:\n  ma5team@iphc.cnrs.fr\n\nThat's all folks!\n",
