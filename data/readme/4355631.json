  "README.md": "Welcome to DNest3\n=================\n\nDNest3 is a free software\nC++ implementation of Diffusive Nested Sampling, a Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for Bayesian Inference and Statistical Mechanics.\n\nRelative to older DNest versions, DNest3 has improved performance\n(in terms of the sampling overhead, likelihood evaluations still dominate in\ngeneral) and is cleaner code: implementing new models should be easier than it\nwas before. In addition, DNest3 is multi-threaded, so you can run multiple\nMCMC walkers at the same time, and the results will be combined together.\n\nFor documentation (currently in a draft state),\nplease compile the LaTeX manual in the doc directory.\n\nThe Paper\n=========\n\nBefore you use DNest3, you might want to read the paper describing the\nDiffusive Nested Sampling algorithm. If you find this software useful in your\nown work, please also feel free to cite this paper.\n\nDiffusive Nested Sampling\nBrendon J. Brewer, Livia B. P\u00e1rtay, and G\u00e1bor Cs\u00e1nyi\nStatistics and Computing, 2011, 21, 4, 649-656.\n\nThe paper is [freely available online](http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2380) at\nthe [arXiv](http://www.arxiv.org/).\n\nDependencies\n============\n\nDNest3 requires that you have the following packages installed on your\ncomputer. The first two will be required to compile the C++ part of DNest3\nwhich is responsible for the MCMC runs themselves.\n\n* [GNU Scientific Library (GSL)](http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/)\n* [Boost](http://www.boost.org/)\n\nThese extra packages will be needed to execute the postprocessing\nand plotting code, which is written in Python.\n\n* [Python 2](http://www.python.org/)\n* [NumPy](http://numpy.scipy.org/)\n* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/)\n\nMac\n---\n\nIf you're using a Mac, hopefully you're also using\n[Homebrew](http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/) or\n[Macports](https://www.macports.org/). Please do it.\n\nNow that we've got that out of the way, install the dependencies:\n\n```\nbrew install cmake gsl boost\n```\n\nor\n\n```\nsudo port install cmake gsl boost\n```\n\nUbuntu\n------\n\nInstall the dependencies as follows:\n\n```\nsudo apt-get install libgsl0-dev\nsudo apt-get install python-numpy python-matplotlib\nsudo apt-get install libboost-thread-dev libboost-system-dev\nsudo apt-get install cmake\n```\n\nBuilding\n========\n\nYou can build DNest3 using [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/):\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/eggplantbren/DNest3.git\nmkdir DNest3/build\ncd DNest3/build\ncmake ..\nmake\nmake install\n```\n\n<!--Then please copy postprocess.py to somewhere in your PYTHONPATH, or add the-->\n<!--DNest3 directory to your PYTHONPATH.-->\n\nThis will install the DNest3 library and header files into `/usr/local`, while\nexample programs are available in `DNest3/Examples`.  If required,\nchange the installation location by giving a `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` option\nto CMake:\n\n```\ncmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/tmp ..\n```\n\nOther useful options include:\n\n* `-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=debug`\n\n  Turn off optimization and include debugging symbols: the resulting code will\n  be much slower.\n\n* `-DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=true`\n\n  Build `libdnest3` as a shared library.\n\n* `-DBUILD_MANUAL=true`\n\n  Build a PDF manual in `DNest3/doc`. Requires pdfLaTeX.\n\n\nCopyright and Licence\n=====================\n\nDNest3 is Copyright (c) 2009-2015 Brendon J.
