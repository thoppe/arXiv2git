If you cite a preprint paper, this will automatically update the entry to the published version, when it is published\n2. For really long bibtex files, its much easier to manage a list of bibcodes than bibtex entries, and you can divide\n them into sections with comments i.e.\n\n```bash\n# Transmission Spectroscopy\n2008Natur.452..329S  Swain2008  # The presence of methane in the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet\n2006AGUSM.A21A..06T  Tinetti2006\n\n# Detrending Techniques\n2013ApJ...766....7W  Waldmann2013\n```\n\nIt is also fast after the initial run, entries are cached so they are only fetched from ADS again after they are older than your ttl (time to live) setting in the config. This means you can integrate it into your latex compilation without worrying about it adding a significant overhead to your build.\n\n## Setup and installation\n\nYou'll need an ADS API key, the following is from the `ads` [module docs](https://github.com/andycasey/ads)\n\n1. You'll need an API key from NASA ADS labs. Sign up for the newest version of ADS search at https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu, visit account settings and generate a new API token. The official documentation is available at https://github.com/adsabs/adsabs-dev-api\n2. When you get your API key, save it to a file called ``~/.ads/dev_key`` or save it as an environment variable named ``ADS_DEV_KEY``\n\nThen install this package\n\n```bash\npip install adsbibtex\n```\n\nor get the latest development version from here with\n\n```bash\ngit clone https://github.com/ryanvarley/adsbibtex.git\ncd adsabs-dev-api\npython setup.py install\n```\n\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\nadsbibtex <config_file>\n```\n\nconfig_file defaults to `config.adsbib`, see the next section for an example file\n\n## Example config file\n\nThe config file consists of a top section of `yaml` where the config is stored and a list of bibcode citename entries\n(after `---`). Comments can be entered with `#`.\n\nAll entries must have a valid bibcode, if no citename is given then the bibcode will be the citename\n\n```bash\n# YAML front matter (config)\ncache_ttl:   24  # hours\ncache_file:  adsbibtex_cache\nbibtex_file: example.bib\n---\n#   Bibcode          Name          # Optional Comment\n2008Natur.452..329S  Swain2008\n2006AGUSM.A21A..06T                # no name needed\n\n# You can use comments to divide papers into sections\n2013ApJ...766....7W  Waldmann2013  # You could put the paper title or subject here\n```\n\nRunning `adsbibtex` on this file produces the following output\n\n```bibtex\n@ARTICLE{Swain2008,\n   author = {{Swain}, M.~R. and {Vasisht}, G. and {Tinetti}, G.},\n    title = \"{The presence of methane in the atmosphere of an extrasolar planet}\",\n  journal = {\\nat},\n     year = 2008,\n    month = mar,\n   volume = 452,\n    pages = {329-331},\n      doi = {10.1038/nature06823},\n   adsurl = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008Natur.452..329S},\n  adsnote = {Provided by the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System}\n}\n\n@ARTICLE{2006AGUSM.A21A..06T,\n   author = {{Tinetti}, G. and {Meadows}, V.~S. and {Crisp}, D. and {Kiang}, N. and \n\t{Fishbein}, E. and {Kahn}, B. and {Turnbull}, M.},\n    title = \"{Detectability of Surface and Atmospheric Signatures in the Disk-averaged Spectra of the Earth}\",\n  journal = {AGU Spring Meeting Abstracts},\n keywords = {5210 Planetary atmospheres, clouds, and hazes (0343), 5704 Atmospheres (0343, 1060), 0343 Planetary atmospheres (5210, 5405, 5704), 0406 Astrobiology and extraterrestrial materials},\n     year = 2006,\n    month = may,\n    pages = {A6},\n   adsurl = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006AGUSM.A21A..06T},\n  adsnote = {Provided by the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System}\n}\n\n@ARTICLE{Waldmann2013,\n   author = {{Waldmann}, I.~P. and {Tinetti}, G. and {Deroo}, P. and {Hollis}, M.~D.~J. and \n\t{Yurchenko}, S.~N. and {Tennyson}, J.},\n    title = \"{Blind Extraction of an Exoplanetary Spectrum through Independent Component Analysis}\",\n  journal = {\\apj},\narchivePrefix = \"arXiv\",\n   eprint = {1301.4041},\n primaryClass = \"astro-ph.EP\",\n keywords = {methods: data analysis, methods: observational, methods: statistical, planets and satellites: atmospheres, planets and satellites: individual: HD189733b, techniques: spectroscopic },\n     year = 2013,\n    month = mar,\n   volume = 766,\n      eid = {7},\n    pages = {7},\n      doi = {10.1088/0004-637X/766/1/7},\n   adsurl = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013ApJ...766....7W},\n  adsnote = {Provided by the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System}\n}\n```\n",
