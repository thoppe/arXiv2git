Simonyan, A. Zisserman\narXiv:1409.1556\n\nVGGNet details:\nVGG16 model - ILSVRC - 2014 competition\nMean = [103.909, 116.779, 123.68]\nBGR format\nYou can find the model weights file in the below link:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz7KyqmuGsilT0J5dmRCM0ROVHc/view?usp=sharing\n\nI have tried to extract hidden layer activations from different layers of the network for every image and \naveraged the activations of all images belong to one restaurant. I have used the averaged activation values as features for restaurants.\n\nI have used Theano and Keras for extracting layer level weights and activations for images\n\nMultilabel_clf.ipynb code classifies restaurants in to any one of the 9 labels (0-8). I have used svm and random forest classifiers.\nLabels:\n0: good_for_lunch\n1: good_for_dinner\n2: takes_reservations\n3: outdoor_seating\n4: restaurant_is_expensive\n5: has_alcohol\n6: has_table_service\n7: ambience_is_classy\n8: good_for_kids\n\nin Multilabel_clf.ipynb, I have setup a cv and thorugh tuning of hyper parameters\n\nYou can read about the problem more at: https://www.kaggle.com/c/yelp-restaurant-photo-classification\n",
