  "README.md": "yahapj.bst: yet another hacked ApJ bibtex style\n===============================================\n\nThis Git repository contains `yahapj.bst`, a BibTeX style file for creating\nbibliographies in the format used by the Astrophysical Journal. It largely\noperates like `apj.bst`, in that your bibliography will closely resemble what\nis required for articles in the Astrophysical Journal. However it has a few\nnice new features:\n\n+ ArXiV identifiers and links are included for those entries\n  that don't contain any more formal reference information.\n+ DOI links are embedded if available.\n+ Trailing plus signs in page numbers are removed.\n+ Automatic compatibility with the [jabbrv] journal name abbreviation package.\n+ Maintenance in Git makes it easy to stay updated.\n\n[jabbrv]: http://www.compholio.com/latex/jabbrv/\n\n\nHow to Use It\n-------------\n\n1. Use BibTeX for your bibliography. Help with this is beyond the scope of\n   this file.\n2. Download [yahapj.bst] and save it in the directory containing your LaTeX\n   file.\n3. Make sure your LaTeX file uses the [hyperref] package. For attractive\n   links, we suggest:\n\n   ```\n   \\usepackage[breaklinks,colorlinks,\n      urlcolor=blue,citecolor=blue,linkcolor=blue]{hyperref}\n   ```\n4. For your `\\bibliographystyle{}` command, put:\n\n   ```\n   \\bibliographystyle{yahapj}\n   ```\n\nThat's all there is to it! If you're really adventurous, [see\nbelow](#year-only-links) about optionally tweaking link formatting with deep\nLaTeX magic.\n\n[yahapj.bst]: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pkgw/yahapj/master/yahapj.bst\n[hyperref]: http://www.ctan.org/pkg/hyperref\n\n\nMaking & Sharing Improvements\n-----------------------------\n\nThe style file is derived from the venerable `apj.bst` and adds some features\nwhich are mostly cribbed from other hacked versions of this file, especially\nthe `hapj.bst` provided by ArXiv. We hope that by importing a version of this\nfile into Git, improvements can be shared more easily.\n\nIf you make changes to this file that you'd like to share, just clone the Git\nrepository and commit away! At least one incarnation of the Git repository is\naccessible on GitHub, with all of the social coding features that that\nentails, at https://github.com/pkgw/yahapj/.\n\nIf you'd like to make changes to the style file, you may run into the minor\nproblem that BibTeX style files are implemented in a bizarre nonce language.\nThe best reference I've been able to find is \"[Tame the BeaST][tame],\" by\n[Nicolas Markey][markey].\n\n[tame]: http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/~markey/BibTeX/doc/ttb_en.pdf\n[markey]: http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/~markey/\n\n\nProvenance\n----------\n\nThe history of recent changes to the style file should be discovered by\nconsulting the Git history.\n\nThe seed file for the Git repository is based upon revision 1.7 of `apj.bst`\nfrom the [astronat] package provided by the NASA [Astrophysics Data\nSystem][ads]. That file was originally generated from `merlin.mbs`, which was\nwritten by Patrick W. Daly. Subsequent changes were contributed by Jonathan E.\nBaker, Tim Robishaw, Craig Wiegert, Andrew R. Marble, Stephan Fegan, and\nAlberto Accomazzi.\n\nThe seed file adds in the changes in [hapj.bst] provided by\n[arxiv.org][arxiv], which were added by Varendra (Alvin) Das. The version of\nthe file provided by arxiv.org is based on what is effectively revision 1.5 of\nthe ADS `apj.bst`.\n\nIt also incorporates new-style arxiv identifiers from Jacques Distler's\n[utphys.bst].\n\nThese changes were collected and some further cleanups were made by Peter K.\nG. Williams.\n\n[ads]: http://adsabs.harvard.edu/\n[arxiv]: http://arxiv.org/\n[astronat]: http://ads.harvard.edu/pubs/bibtex/astronat/\n[hapj.bst]: http://arxiv.org/hypertex/bibstyles/\n[utphys.bst]: http://golem.ph.utexas.edu/~distler/TeXstuff/utphys.bst\n\n\nYear-Only Links\n---------------\n\nBecause this style requires [hyperref], your manuscript will be filled with\nactive links from your `\\cite` command to the references. If you compare with\nthe actual published ApJ, however, you'll note that in your PDF the entire\nreference (e.g., \"Jones et al. 2013\") is a link, whereas in ApJ only the year\nis.\n\nIf you want to get really hard-core -- or if the full-reference links give too\nmuch blue text on each page for your tastes -- here is some magic LaTeX code to\nhack the `\\cite` commands to look like ApJ. This is blindly copied off of\n[this StackExchange answer] by [\"Audrey\"], and I have no freaking idea how it\nworks. But it works for me.\n\n    % In preamble:\n    \\usepackage{etoolbox}\n    \n    \\makeatletter\n    \n    % Patch case where name and year are separated by aysep\n    \\patchcmd{\\NAT@citex}\n      {\\@citea\\NAT@hyper@{%\n         \\NAT@nmfmt{\\NAT@nm}%\n         \\hyper@natlinkbreak{\\NAT@aysep\\NAT@spacechar}{\\@citeb\\@extra@b@citeb}%\n         \\NAT@date}}\n      {\\@citea\\NAT@nmfmt{\\NAT@nm}%\n       \\NAT@aysep\\NAT@spacechar\\NAT@hyper@{\\NAT@date}}{}{}\n    \n    % Patch case where name and year are separated by opening bracket\n    \\patchcmd{\\NAT@citex}\n      {\\@citea\\NAT@hyper@{%\n         \\NAT@nmfmt{\\NAT@nm}%\n         \\hyper@natlinkbreak{\\NAT@spacechar\\NAT@@open\\if*#1*\\else#1\\NAT@spacechar\\fi}%\n           {\\@citeb\\@extra@b@citeb}%\n         \\NAT@date}}\n      {\\@citea\\NAT@nmfmt{\\NAT@nm}%\n       \\NAT@spacechar\\NAT@@open\\if*#1*\\else#1\\NAT@spacechar\\fi\\NAT@hyper@{\\NAT@date}}\n      {}{}\n    \n    \\makeatother\n\nI presume that if you include this kind of code in the LaTeX files you\nactually send to the journal, they'll freak out at you. But you can put it in\nyour Arxiv submissions to make them look classy.\n\n[this StackExchange answer]: http://tex.stackexchange.com/a/27311\n[\"Audrey\"]: http://tex.stackexchange.com/users/4483/audrey\n\nAlternatively, it appears that [biblatex] has built-in support for this, but\nthen you wouldn't be using this package!\n\n[biblatex]: http://www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex\n\n\nCopyright Status of `yahapj.bst`\n--------------------------------\n\nThe original `merlin.mbs` claimed copyright from 1994-1998 for Patrick W.\nDaly. Subsequent files have been copied and modified by numerous parties all\nover the Internet. In assembling this repository, I have deemed it fair to\ndedicate the style file to the public domain.\n\nNote that the original file did come with the following notice from within\n`merlin.mbs`:\n\n> This file may be used for non-profit purposes. It may not be distributed in\n> exchange for money, other than distribution costs. The author provides it\n> \"as is\" and does not guarantee it in any way.\n\nIt is not clear to me (Peter Williams) if this clause applies to the generated\nBibTeX style file, or only the source `merlin.mbs` file. If the notice does\nnot apply to `yahapj.bst`, or `yahapj.bst` is treated as being in the public\ndomain, the \"non-profit\" clause is inoperative, and you may attempt to\ndistribute it in exchange for money. Have fun with that.\n\n\nCopyright Status of This File\n-----------------------------\n\nThis README file is also dedicated to the public domain. You have unlimited\npermission to copy, distribute, and modify it.\n\n\nContributors\n------------\n\n+ Alberto Accomazzi (aaccomazzi@cfa.harvard.edu)\n+ Jonathan E.
