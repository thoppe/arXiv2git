The slides are in the file `hcap.pdf` in this repository. Below is the abstract of the paper.\r\n\r\n###  Abstract\r\nIn this note, we show that the half-plane capacity of a subset of the upper half-plane is comparable to a simple geometric quantity, namely the euclidean area of the hyperbolic neighborhood of radius one of this set. This is achieved by proving a similar estimate for the conformal radius of a subdomain of the unit disc, and by establishing a simple relation between these two quantities.\r\n",
