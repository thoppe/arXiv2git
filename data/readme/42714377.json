  "README": "-------- JEWEL --------\n\nhomepage: jewel.hepforge.org\ncontact : jewel@projects.hepforge.org\n\n-----------------------\n\nCONTENTS:\n\n1. REFERENCES\n\n2. GETTING STARTED\n\n3. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\n4. DISCLAIMER\n\n------------------------\n\n1. REFERENCES\n-------------\n\nThe manual with information on how to run JEWEL can be obtained from \narXiv:1311.0048.\n\nIf you use this code for scientific work please cite the manual for the code and\nJHEP 1303 (2013) 080 [arXiv:1212.1599] and optionally EPJC C60 (2009) 617 \n[arXiv:0804.3568] for the physics.\n\n\n2. GETTING STARTED\n------------------\n\nJEWEL needs LHAPDF to provide the PDF's. Install LHAPDF following the instructions \non the LHAPDF web page (lhapdf.hepforge.org) and download the PDF sets you want to \nuse. In its default setup JEWEL needs the CTEPQ6LL (number 10042) and EPS09LOR_208 \nsets. The latter can be downloaded from the EPS09 web page (www.jyu.fi/fysiikka/en/\nresearch/highenergy/urhic/eps09).\n\nThe provided Makefile assumes that JEWEL will be compiled with gfortran. People who \nwish to use a different compiler have to modify the Makefile accordingly.\n\nDownload and unpack the tarball. \n$ tar xvzf jewel-2.0.0.tar.gz\nEdit the line \nLHAPDF_PATH := /path/to/lhapdf \nin the Makefile to point to your LHAPDF installation.\nCompile the code by typing 'make'. The result of this are two executables: \njewel-2.0.0-vac and jewel-2.0.0-simple. The former simulates jet evolution in vacuum \n(i.e. in e-e+ or pp collisions) while the latter simulates jet evolution in the \npresence of a medium. In this case the medium is modelled by an ideal gas of quarks and \ngluons undergoing boost-invariant longitudinal expansion with a transverse profile derived \nfrom a Glauber model.\n\nThe following paths need to be set for JEWEL to run: \n$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/lhapdf/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH\n$ export LHAPATH=/path/to/lhapdf/share/lhapdf/PDFsets\nTo run JEWEL with the default setting no parameter file is needed: \n$./jewel-2.0.0-simple \nor \n$./jewel-2.0.0-vac \nNote, however, that also in the latter case nuclear PDF's will be used.\n\nA parameter file can to be passed to change the setting: \n$./jewel-2.0.0-simple params.example.dat \nThe file params.example.dat is included in the tarball as an example for a parameter file. The \nfile can contain one parameter per line, the format is <name><value>. Lines starting with a hash \nare comment lines. For a list of parameters and their dafault values please refer to the manual.\n\n\n3. ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n-------------------\n\nJEWEL relies heavily on PYTHIA 6 (pythia6.hepforge.org) for the event generation. The modified \nversion of PYTHIA 6.4.25 that is distributed with JEWEL is, however, not an official PYTHIA \nrelease and must not be used for anything else. Please refer to results as \"JEWEL+PYTHIA\".\n\nJEWEL contains code provided by S. Zhang and J. M. Jing  (Computation of Special Functions,\nJohn Wiley & Sons, New York, 1996 and http://jin.ece.illinois.edu) for computing the exponential \nintegral Ei(x).\n\nThe medium model was partly implemented by Jochen Klein [Jochen.Klein@cern.ch].\n\n\n4. DISCLAIMER\n-------------\n\nThe JEWEL code is provided without any warranty, users should be wary and use common\nsense when judging and interpreting their results. It is copyrighted but may be used for\nscientific work provided proper reference is given.\n\n\n\nCopyright Korinna C. Zapp (2013) [Korinna.Zapp@cern.ch] \n",
