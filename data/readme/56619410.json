  "README.md": "Forked from Brendan Brewer's DNest4 Repository\n\nDNest4\n======\n\nDNest4 is a C++11 implementation of Diffusive Nested Sampling, a Markov Chain\nMonte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm for Bayesian Inference and Statistical Mechanics.\n\nThe Paper\n=========\n\nBefore you use DNest4, you might want to read the paper describing the\nDiffusive Nested Sampling algorithm. If you find this software useful in your\nresearch, please cite this paper.\n\nDiffusive Nested Sampling\nBrendon J. Brewer, Livia B. Partay, and Gabor Csanyi\nStatistics and Computing, 2011, 21, 4, 649-656.\n\nThe paper is [freely available online](http://arxiv.org/abs/0912.2380) at\nthe [arXiv](http://www.arxiv.org/).\n\nImprovements over DNest3:\n=========================\n\n*\tThere are far fewer dependencies --- all you need is a C++ compiler that\n\tsupports the C++11 standard, along with Python, NumPy, and Matplotlib\n\tfor the post-processing scripts. Because of this, it should be much easier\n\tto compile (at least on a Unix-like operating system such as Ubuntu or\n\tMac OS X).\n\n*\tThe licence is now the permissive MIT licence.\n\n*\tRJObject (which allows relatively straightforward implementation of\n\thierarchical and trans-dimensional mixture models)\n\tis now included in the same repository.\n\nSome functions have slightly different names and specifications compared to\nDNest3. These changes are purely cosmetic.\nThe manual (in the doc directory) can be compiled with pdflatex.\n\n(c) 2015--2016 Brendon J.
