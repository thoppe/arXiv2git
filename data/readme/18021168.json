  "README.md": "#Sparse MultiFrontal Package: A Fast Sparse Matrix Factorization Package \n\nThis software is a sparse multifrontal solver with fast factorization capabilty. It uses Hierarchically off-diagonal low-rank (HODLR) structures to approximate the frontal matrices and arrives at a fast solver that performs extremely well as a GMRES preconditioner. In addition, it provides both implicit and explicit conventional LU factorization capabilities.\n\n####Author :  \n\nAmirhossein Aminfar: amirhossein.aminfar@gmail.com\n\n####Citation:\n\nIf you use the implementation or any part of the implementation in your work, kindly cite as follows:\n\n####Articles:\n\n@article{aminfar2015fastMF,\n\nauthor={{A}minfar, {A}mirhossein and {A}mbikasaran, {S}ivaram and {D}arve, {E}ric},\n\ntitle={A Fast Sparse Solver with Applications to Finite-Element Matrices},\n\njournal={arXiv:1410.2697},\n\nyear={2015}\n\n}\n\n\n@article{aminfar2014fast,\n\nauthor={{A}minfar, {A}mirhossein and {A}mbikasaran, {S}ivaram and {D}arve, {E}ric},\n\ntitle={A Fast Block Low-Rank Dense Solver with Applications to Finite-Element Matrices},\n\njournal={arXiv:1403.5337},\n\nyear={2014}\n\n}\n\n####Code\n\n@MISC{aminfar2015fastMFCode,\n\nauthor = {{A}minfar, {A}mirhossein},\n\ntitle = {A fast sparse solver with HODLR compression},\n\nhowpublished = {https://github.com/amiraa127/Sparse_MultiFrontal},\n\nyear = {2015}\n\n}\n\n\n####Version 1.00\n\nDate: April 8th, 2015\n\nCopyleft 2015: Amirhossein Aminfar \n\nDeveloped by Amirhossein Aminfar\n\n####License\n\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it under the terms of MPL2 license.

[Eigen] (http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) C++ library for all matrix manipulations.\n\n2. [SOTCH] (http://www.labri.fr/perso/pelegrin/scotch/) for nested dissection and matrix reordering.\n\n3. [HODLR Package] (https://github.com/amiraa127/Dense_HODLR) for the fast multifrontal solver. After downloading the package, change the line `set(HODLR_Path /path/to/files/)` in `CMakeLists.txt` to the HODLR package directory.\n\n4. [CPP Unit] (http://sourceforge.net/projects/cppunit/) for unit testing.\n\nThe easiest way to build the library is to use [CMake](http://www.cmake.org).\nGo to the project directory and run:\n\n```\nmkdir build\ncd build\ncmake ../\nmake\n```\n\n####Documentation\nComing soon.....",
