Dynamic processes\nsuch as percolation can be visualized using animation.\n\n* [Journal Page](http://dx.doi.org/10.1209/0295-5075/81/68004)\n* [arXiv preprint](http://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0703470)\n* [Additional matrices and animations](http://people.clarkson.edu/~dbenavra/B_matrix_site/).\n\n\nAbout the code\n--------------\n\n`B_matrix.py` and `B_matrix.cpp` take an edgelist file and write the\ncorresponding *B*-matrix to a file\n\nAn edgelist is an *M* x 2 matrix for a graph with *M* edges. The C++ code\nrequires nodes be sequential integers numbered from zero, while the python code\nis slower, but much more flexible (can handle directed networks for example,\nwhich the C++ cannot) and forgiving. Python code requires [networkx] and\n(optionally) [pylab] to plot.\n\nUnless the networks are very large, I greatly encourage using the python code\ninstead of the C++.  Additionally, networkx has undergone a great deal of\nupdates and the `B_matrices.py` file might be slightly out of date, requiring\nsmall changes to work again.  Fair warning, buyer beware, etc.\n\nVarious matlab m-files are included for loading a *B*-matrix from file,\ntrimming empty columns, and computing the distance between two matrices. The\nlatter is accomplished using `B_Distance.m`, which takes two matrices as input\nand returns the distance as described in the paper. It will optionally also\nplot the row-wise distances.\n\nThe m-files may also work in [octave], an open source \"clone\" of matlab but I\nhaven't tried so I make no guarantees.\n\n- Jim Bagrow, 2008-04-17\n- bagrowjp [at] gmail [dot] com\n\n\n[networkx]: http://networkx.lanl.gov/\n[pylab]: http://matplotlib.org\n[octave]: http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/\n\n",
