You can find more information in this paepr: http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.03844\n\nThe usage is easy: after compiling using \"make\", there will be 2 executable files \"nmi\" and \"rnmi\", which calculate NMI and rNMI respectively. \nto calculate NMI of two configuration stored in 1.conf and 2.conf (labeling start form 0), you can use\n\"./nmi 1.conf 2.conf\"\n\nTo compute rNMI, \n\"./rnmi 1.conf 2.conf\"\n\nPan Zhang\npan@santafe.edu\nhttp://panzhang.net\n\nCarlo Nicolini\n",
