  "README.md": "# galaxyz\nClass assignment: Computing the two-point angular correlation function\n\nThis is my home assignment from class Advanced Computer Graphics and Graphics Hardware,\nI'm currently taking at Abo Akademi. The idea is to run given example program on GPU,\nwhich otherwise calculates 'something something' and that proves existence of dark matter.\nI'm not really good at physics so for me it's just 'something something', but who is \ninterested can read this: http://arxiv.org/abs/1208.3658\n\nInfo on kernel versions:\nKernel v1: This is basically merge of given example for performing calculations and OpenCL example\nKernel v2: Performing calculations only on bottom triange of matrix for DD and RR\nKernel v3: Using two dimensions for performing calculations\nKernel v4: Using local memory for storing results\nKernel v5: Modified version pf Kernel v2, now using same approach but in two dimensions\nKernel v6: Since now, every work item performed one calculation. This version introduce for loop \n\t\t\twhich perform more than one calculation, which lead to less necessary work items\nKernel v7: Updated version of Kernel v6 which use local memory\n\nSince now Kernel v5/v6 showed best performance running on NVidia Tesla M2050 GPU.",
