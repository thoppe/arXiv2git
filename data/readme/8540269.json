DOI: [10.5061/dryad.3066j](http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.3066j).\n\n## Figure reproduction\n\nFigures were produced using Python with numpy, scipy, matplotlib, pandas, scikits-bootstrap, statsmodels, and mpltools packages. The code is available as an [IPython (Jupyter) notebook](https://github.com/yoavram/ruggedsim/blob/master/manuscript/supplementry.ipynb). The notebook includes the analytic approximations as Python functions and uses the simulation raw data which is necessary for Figures 2, 3, S1, S2, and F1.\n\n### License\n\nAll code in this repo is under the CC-BY-SA licence.\n\nThe data used for the publication is deposited at [dryad](http://dx.doi.org/10.5061/dryad.3066j) under a CC0 license.\n\nThe licenses of the versions of the manuscript published by [Proceedings B](http://prsb2014.yoavram.com) and posted to [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.3548) and [bioRxiv](http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/007096) appear on the respective websites.\n\n[SIDEER2013]: http://sideer2013.yoavram.com/\n",
