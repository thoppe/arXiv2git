(see https://code.google.com/archive/p/narorumo/) and https://code.google.com/p/narorumo/wiki/SudokuDLX\nAll external sources that used have been referencened and are after lots of modifications. Also, thank all TA's to teach me a general idea on how to implement the project. in Monday's TA session \n\n\n##An executable app (jar file)(please click here to access my app): https://www.dropbox.com/s/0jdus5naguc2z9f/puzzle.jar?dl=0\n",
