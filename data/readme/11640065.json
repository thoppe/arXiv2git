  "README.m": "% ----------------------------------------------------------------\n% CliqueTop Package\n% README \n% written by Chad Giusti, 9/2014\n% contact: cgiusti@seas.upenn.edu\n%\n% CliqueTop is a MATLAB package for doing topological analysis of \n% correlation matrices. It was initially designed to study the \n% persistent homology of cross-correlations between activity of\n% neurons in a population, but it computes invariants of general \n% symmetric real matrices under element-wise monotonic increasing \n% transformations. For details of what these invariants measure, \n% please see \n%   Giusti, Pastalkova, Curto, Itskov, \"Clique topology reveals \n%   intrinsic geometric structure in neural correlations\"\n%   (arXiv:1502.06172 [q-bio.NC] and arXiv:1502.06173 [q-bio.NC])\n%\n% CliqueTop currently relies on Perseus for persistent homology\n% computations and Cliquer as a starting point the 'split' clique\n% enumeration algorithm. Both pieces of software are included in\n% this archive for ease of use and require no further installation.\n% They can be found at:\n%\n%  - Perseus 4.0B by Vidit Nanda, currently available at \n%       http://www.sas.upenn.edu/~vnanda/perseus/index.html.\n%  - Cliquer by Sampo Niskanen, currently available at\n%       http://users.aalto.fi/~pat/cliquer.html\n%\n% The current implementation's computational limits occur at the\n% level of the persistent homology computation in Perseus. For a \n% 100x100 symmetric matrix, the complete process requires roughly\n% on the order of 16 GB of RAM and 45 minutes of computation time\n% on a powerful desktop computer (as of 11/2014). Insufficient RAM\n% to complete the computation will cause Perseus to crash and the\n% process to abort. However, the simplicial complex portion of the \n% computation will be stored in the intermediate computation file \n% (by default,  'matrix_simplices.txt') and can be rerun in Perseus \n% from the command line either on a more powerful computer or after\n% restricting to a smaller number of filtrations to reduce the\n% required memory.\n%\n% Usage: ---------------------------------------------------------\n%\n% The primary interface for using the package is the function\n%\n%   compute_clique_topology( inputMatrix )\n%\n% or\n%\n%   compute_clique_topology( inputMatrix, 'ParameterName', Param )\n%\n% which can be run on any symmetric matrix with real entries. \n% We recommend not running this process on matrices larger than \n% 100 x 100 unless your computer has substantial memory and \n% processing power, as clique enumeration is part of this process.\n% Depending on the size and structure of the matrix, computations \n% can take several days. \n%\n% By default, the function's first output will be a matrix with \n% three columns, respectively the first through third Betti curves\n% of the order complex for the matrix on the density range [0, 0.6].\n% The function also produces persistence lifetime information, as\n% secondary output arguments.\n%\n% For details on optional parameters for the clique topology \n% computation, see the documentation of the compute_clique_topology\n% function.\n%\n% Algorithms: ----------------------------------------------------\n%\n% There are three algorithms for clique enumeration implemented\n% in this package. By default, a naive algorithm that does not \n% enumerate maximal cliques is used. This algorithm is less memory\n% intensive, but does not allow for maximal clique statistics and \n% may be slower in some cases. The algorithm used in the paper \n% cited above was the 'split' algorithm, which can be used\n% by selecting the appropriate parameter, as detailed in the \n% documentation.\n%\n% ----------------------------------------------------------------\n",
