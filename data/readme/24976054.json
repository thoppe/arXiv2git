  "README.md": "Speaker-Label-Propagation-Algorithm\r\n===================================\r\n\r\nSpeaker Label Propagation Algorithm for detecting communites in a graph. \r\n\r\nThis project is implemntation of paper titled \"Towards Linear Time Overlapping Community Detection in Social Networks\"(http://arxiv.org/pdf/1202.2465.pdf)\r\n\r\n\r\n1.MINIMUM REQUIRED SOFTWARE:\r\n\tApache Maven 3.0.5 (mvn -version) \r\n\tJava 1.7.0_67      (java -version)\r\n\r\n2.INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM\r\n\ta.Go to the root folder of the project where pom.xml is present\r\n\t\tcd slpa\r\n\tb.Do a maven build\r\n\t\tmvn clean install\r\n\tc.Run the SLPA algorithm with the arguments as: \r\n\t\tmvn exec:java -Dexec.args=\"<input_graph_path> <output_graph_path> <number_of_iterations> <threshold>\"\r\n\t\texampe:mvn exec:java -Dexec.args=\"amazon.graph.original amazon.graph.comm 20 0.5\"\r\n\r\n3.ALTERNATE INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM\r\n\ta.Go to the root folder of the project where pom.xml is present\r\n\t\tcd slpa\r\n\tb.Do a maven build\r\n\t\tmvn clean install\r\n\tc.Go to the folder where jar is located after maven build\r\n\t\tcd target\r\n\td.Run the SLPA algorithm from the jar\r\n\t\tjava -jar slpa-0.0.1.jar <input_graph_path> <output_graph_path> <number_of_iterations> <threshold>\r\n\t\texample:java -jar slpa-0.0.1.jar amazon.graph.original amazon.graph.comm 20 0.5\r\n\t\t\r\n4.INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO INTERPRET THE RESULTS\r\n\tThe output will be the communities that are found by running the SLPA algorithm.Each line in the output\r\n\tfile represents a community with nodes delimited by a space character.Each community is represented in the \r\n\tnew line.\r\n\tEXAMPLE OUTPUT:\r\n\t0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 \r\n\t16 12 13 14 15 \r\n\t\r\n5. SAMPLE INPUT AND OUTPUT FILES.\r\n\tCheck the Results folder for sample input and output.\r\n\ta.Input file in the first line consist of number of vertices(m) and number of edges(n) delimited by space.\r\n\t  Rest of the lines consists of the all the edges represented as \"from to\".\r\n\t  Example:\r\n\t\t16716 48739\r\n\t\t0 1\r\n\t\t0 2\r\n\t\t0 3\r\n\t\t0 4\r\n\t\t0 5\r\n\t\t0 6\r\n\t\t7 8\r\n\t\t7 9\r\n\t\t7 10\r\n\t\t7 11\r\n\t\t....\r\n\t\t....\r\n\t\t\r\n\tb.Output will be the communities determined out from the graph as mentioned in Step 4.\r\n\t",
