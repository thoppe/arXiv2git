There is a nice lecture on [Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs / ConvNets)](http://cs231n.github.io/convolutional-networks/) which provides an architectural overview as well as detailed explanations of the different layers and popular architectures.\n\nA nice collection of final reports by the course students is available [here](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports.html). The following ones are specially remarkable:\n\n- [Tiny ImageNet Challenge - Dissection of a convolutional neural network](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/jbboin_finalreport.pdf). Explains a simple architecture and dissects it with useful insight. Besides, the figures are nice and can serve as inspiration.\n- [Learning 3D Object Orientations From Synthetic Images](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/rqi_final_report.pdf). Cool approach to mix 3D training data (which is converted to 2D) with 2D input images for object orientation detection.\n- [Convolutional Neural Networks for Fashion Classification and Object Detection](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/reports/BLAO_KJAG_CS231N_FinalPaperFashionClassification.pdf). Multiple object detection in the same image, instead of single object per image.\n\n### Deep Neural Networks (DNN)\n\n## Frameworks\n\n### Torch\n\n[Torch](http://torch.ch/) is a scientific computing framework which supports a wide variety of machine learning algorithms. Characterized by an easy use thanks to its LuaJIT scripting language. It also features significant efficiency due to the underlying CUDA/C implementation.\n\n- [GitHub repository](https://github.com/torch/torch7)\n- [Convolutional Neural Network example with Lua](https://github.com/nicholas-leonard/dp/blob/master/examples/convolutionneuralnetwork.lua)\n- [Object detection with Recursive Convolutional Neural Network and Lua](https://github.com/fmassa/object-detection.torch)\n\n### Caffe\n\n[Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/) is a deep learning framework developed by the [Berkeley Vision and Learning Center (BVLC)](http://bvlc.eecs.berkeley.edu/). It is implemented mainly in C++ and supports GPU computing thanks to CUDA.\n\n- [GitHub repository](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/)\n- [arXiv / ACM MM '14 paper. Caffe: Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding](http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5093)\n- [Hands-On Tutorial: Deep Learning for Vision with Caffe](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UeKXVgRvvxg9OUdh_UiC5G71UMscNPlvArsWER41PsU/edit#slide=id.p)\n\n### Theano\n",
