We have converted ~1 million articles from arXiv.org with this implementation, and consider the CorTeX job manager largely stable. The backend can still benefit of using an ORM such as [diesel.rs](http://diesel.rs/), and the setup of the various framework tasks still requires (imperfectly documented) manual intervention, so I would not advise deploying the repository for third-party use just yet. However, both bug reports and pull requests with enhancements are most welcome and encouraged!",
