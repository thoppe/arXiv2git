  "README.md": "Roborobo - ver.3\n================\n\nRoborobo is a fast and simple 2D mobile robot simulator written in C++ loosely based on a khepera/epuck model. It is targeted for fast single and multi-robots simulation (primary motivation is evolutionary robotics et swarm/collective robotics).\n\nThis is version 3 of Roborobo.\n\nRoborobo only dependencies are: Boost (header-only) and SDL2. Roborobo is used on a daily basis on Linux and MacOS X. It was also tested on various systems, including RaspberryPi, Pandora, MS Windows, Linux in Virtual Box and several Linux-based clusters. \n\nInstallation\n============\n\nCheck _INSTALL.TXT for installation guide (incl. quick start).\nCheck _README.TXT for a quick introduction.\nCheck _FAQ.TXT for trouble shooting and random questions.\n\nCiting roborobo\n===============\n\nIf you use Roborobo (any version) in your work, please cite the following paper:\n\nN.
