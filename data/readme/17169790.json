It is\n designed to be used with model files which we recommend be generated by SARAH,\n a Mathematica package by Florian Staub, and utilizes the MINUIT algorithms by\n Fred James, and uses the Eigen C++ library for matrix inversion and eigenvalue\n calculation. Much of the tunneling code is based on the Python package\n CosmoTransitions, by Carroll (Max) Wainwright.\n \n VevaciousPlusPlus is an implementation of the process of attempting to find\n the minima of a quantum field theory potential with loop and thermal\n corrections, as decided upon by the collaboration of\n Jos Eliel Camargo Molina (elielx@gmail.com),\n Bjrn Garbrecht (garbrecht@tum.de),\n Ben O'Leary (benjamin.oleary@gmail.com),\n Werner Porod (porod@physik.uni-wuerzburg.de), and\n Florian Staub (florian.staub@googlemail.com). This README file was written by\n Ben O'Leary.\n \n A manual describing the physics and process of VevaciousPlusPlus will be\n available from http://arxiv.org/abs/????.???? and there will be a quickstart\n guide available from http://vevacious.hepforge.org/ following the appropriate\n link. A rough version of the installation instructions will be also contained\n in this README file, below the description of the process.\n\n Phase 1) Collect underpants\n Phase 2) ?\n Phase 3) Profit!\n Phase 4) Download and compile the LesHouchesParserClasses (LHPC) C++ library.\n          The files are available at\n          http://www.hepforge.org/downloads/lhpc\n          (link last checked 2014-03-04) or\n          https://github.com/benoleary/LesHouchesParserClasses_CPP\n          (link last checked 2014-03-04). The installation should just be\n          downloading, unzipping, and then running make. Version 0.8.7 or later\n          is necessary!\n Phase 5) Download the Eigen header library, available from\n          http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/index.php?title=Main_Page#Download\n          (link last checked 2014-02-25). No compilation is necessary.\n Phase 6) Compile VevaciousPlusPlus. The Makefile should be edited to have the\n          correct paths to the header files and library file of LHPC (these are\n          /path/to/unzipped/LHPC/include/ and /path/to/unzipped/LHPC/lib/ by\n          default). LHPC version 0.8.7 or higher is required. The Makefile\n          should also have the correct path to the header files from Eigen.\n\n\nTODO:\n * Decent bundled model files\n * TakenPositive for PotentialFromPolynomialAndMasses\n * Implementing BasicPolynomialHomotopyContinuation class\n * Implementing MinuitBounceActionMinimizer class\n\n\nCHANGELOG:\n * 12th May 2014: version 1.0.00.alpha.003\n - Added batch functionality to VevaciousPlusPlus.exe\n - Re-worked PolynomialTerm class a bit to try to increase cache hits by\n   caching the coefficient times functionoid product for a fixed scale through\n   making it derive from BOL::BasicObserver.\n\n * 11th May 2014: version 1.0.00.alpha.002\n - Fixed bundled full MSSM (restricted to real values for the scalar fields and\n   real values for the Lagrangian parameters).\n - Fixed stupid typo in SLHA output from VevaciousPlusPlus class.\n\n * 9th May 2014: version 1.0.00.alpha.001\n - Seems to work on the test case.\n - Needs HOM4PS2 and CosmoTransitions (1 or 2).\n \n * 25th February 2014: version prealpha0001\n - Not even released!\n - Overhaul and rename of VevaciousTwo, which had not been released.\n\n\nThe C++ files of VevaciousPlusPlus are:\n\n <> headers in VevaciousPlusPlus/include/:\n *.hpp\n\n <> source files in VevaciousPlusPlus/source/:\n *.cpp\n\n <> and also:\n VevaciousPlusPlus/Makefile\n and README.VevaciousPlusPlus.txt\n which describes the package (copied as README.txt).\n The makefile creates a single executable in VevaciousPlusPlus/bin/:\n VevaciousPlusPlus.exe, the executable which performs the full set of steps to\n try to find the minima of the loop- and thermal-corrected potential and\n tunneling out of the DSB minimum if it is a false vacuum.\n \n <> Some example files are also given:\n * VevaciousPlusPlus/bin/VevaciousPlusPlusInitialization.xml which is a default\n   initialization file, which uses paths that need to be changed.\n * Various files in VevaciousPlusPlus/ModelFiles/, with the extension .vin,\n   which specify various models.\n   \n \n",
