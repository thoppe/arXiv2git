Segments with residual heterozygosity were detected\nusing an HMM (HMM;http://cran.r-project.org/web/.  The most likely path was calculated using the Viterbi\nalgorithm, and heterozygous segments 10 kb or larger were retained. Heterozygous blocks\nwithin 100kb of one another in a sample strain were clustered together as a single segment\nto define the span of residual heterozygosity within inbred lines.  \n\nFurther description is available in Rogers et al. 2014.\n\n\nSNP VCF files are available at http://molpopgen.org/Data\n\n\nTheta\n===============================\nWe estimate Theta_pi, Theta_W, and Tajima's D for all SNPs in the D. yakuba and D. simulans genomes,\nremoving sites with missing or ambiguous data as well as heterozygous sites. We calculate:\n\n* Window midpoint\n* Number of valid sites with coverage sufficient to assay SNPs\n* Theta_pi for the entire window\n* Theta_W for the entire window\n* Tajima's D \n\nEstimates provided are for 5 kb windows moving in a 500 bp slide across the genome.   Positions in each file designate the window midpoint  Population genetic parameters were calculated using libsequence module for C++ (Thornton, K. 2003).  We exclude all sites with missing data, ambiguous sequence, or heterozygous sites.  \n\n\nCite\n===============================\nRogers et al. 2014  Tandem duplications and the limits of natural selection in *Drosophila yakuba* and *Drosophila simulans*.  http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.0518\n\n",
