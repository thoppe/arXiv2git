  "README.md": "# Neural Style Transfer\nImplementation of Neural Style Transfer from the paper A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style(http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) in Keras 1.0.2\n\nUses the VGG-16 model as described in the Keras example below :\nhttps://github.com/fchollet/keras/blob/master/examples/neural_style_transfer.py\n\n## Weights (VGG 16)\n\nBefore running this script, download the weights for the VGG16 model at:\nhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/0Bz7KyqmuGsilT0J5dmRCM0ROVHc/view?usp=sharing\n(source: https://gist.github.com/baraldilorenzo/07d7802847aaad0a35d3)\nand make sure the variable `weights_path` in this script matches the location of the file.\n\n- Save the weights in the root folder\n- Save a copy of the weights in the root of the windows_helper folder (if you wish to use the Windows Helper tool to easily execute the script)\n\n## Modifications to original implementation :\n- Uses 'conv5_2' output to measure content loss.\nOriginal paper utilizes 'conv4_2' output\n\n- Initial image used for image is the base image (instead of random noise image)\nThis method tends to create better output images, however parameters have to be well tuned.\nTherefore their is a argument 'init_image' which can take the options 'content' or 'noise'\n\n\n- Uses AveragePooling2D inplace of MaxPooling2D layers\nThe original paper uses AveragePooling for better results\n\n- Style weight scaling\n- Rescaling of image to original dimensions, using lossy upscaling present in scipy.imresize()\n- Maintain aspect ratio of intermediate and final stage images, using lossy upscaling\n\nNote : Aspect Ratio is maintained only if image is not rescaled.\n       If image is rescaled to original dimensions then aspect ratio is maintained as well.\n\n## Windows Helper\nIt is a C# program written to more easily generate the arguments for the python script Network.py\n\n- Make sure to save the vgg16_weights.h5 weights file in the windows_helper folder.\n- Upon first run, it will request the python path. Traverse your directory to locate the python.exe of your choice (Anaconda is tested)\n\n### Benefits \n- Automatically executes the script based on the arguments.\n- Easy selection of images (Content, Style, Output Prefix)\n- Easy parameter selection\n- Easily generate argument list, if command line execution is preferred. \n\n# Examples\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/titu1994/Neural_Style_Transfer/master/images/inputs/content/blue-moon-lake.jpg\" width=400 height=300> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/titu1994/Neural_Style_Transfer/master/images/inputs/style/starry_night.jpg\" width=400 height=300>\n<br> Result after 50 iterations <br>\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/titu1994/Neural_Style_Transfer/master/images/output/Blue_Moon_Lake_iteration_50.png\" width=600 height=300>\n<br> DeepArt.io result <br>\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/titu1994/Neural_Style_Transfer/master/images/output/DeepArt_Blue_Moon_Lake.png\" width=600 height=300>\n\n# Network.py in action\n![Alt Text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/titu1994/Neural-Style-Transfer/master/images/Blue%20Moon%20Lake.gif)\n\n# Requirements \n- Theano\n- Keras \n- CUDA (GPU)\n- CUDNN (GPU)\n- Scipy\n- Numpy\n\n# Speed\nOn a 980M GPU, the time required for each epoch depends on mainly image size (gram matrix size) :\n\nFor a 400x400 gram matrix, each epoch takes approximately 11-13 seconds. <br>\nFor a 512x512 gram matrix, each epoch takes approximately 18-22 seconds. <br>\nFor a 600x600 gram matrix, each epoch takes approximately 28-30 seconds. <br>\n  \n# Issues\n- Due to usage of content image as initial image, output depends heavily on parameter tuning. <br> Test to see if the image is appropriate in the first 10 epochs, and if it is correct, increase the number of iterations to smoothen and improve the quality of the output.\n- Generated image is seen to be visually better if a small image size is used.\n- Due to small gram sizes, the output image is usually small. \n<br> To correct this, use the implementations of this paper \"Image Super-Resolution Using Deep Convolutional Networks\" http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00092 to upscale the images with minimal loss.\n<br> <br> <br> Some implementations of the above paper for Windows : https://github.com/tanakamura/waifu2x-converter-cpp\n\n",
