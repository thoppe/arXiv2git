Kinney, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory\n\nLast updated on 23 March 2015 \n\nReference: \n    Kinney JB (2014) \n    Unification of Field Theory and Maximum Entropy Methods for Learning Probability Densities. \n    arXiv:1411.5371 [physics.data-an] http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.5371\n    \nCode: https://github.com/jbkinney/14_maxent\n\n=== Instructions ===\n\nAll computations were performed using the Canopy Python Environment by Enthought, available at https://www.enthought.com/products/canopy/ \n\nDependencies: scipy\n\nThe file *deft_nobc.py* and *deft_utils.py* contain all the density estmation routines used in this paper. Just copy this file to any directory in which you want to peform density estimation, and do execute \"from deft\\_nobc.py import deft\\_nobc\\_1d\" in your Python script\n\nTo see a simple demsontration of the function \"deft_nobc_1d\" in 1 dimension, run *demo.py*\n\nTo recreate Fig. 2, run *fig_2.py*.\n\nTo recreate Fig. 3, run *fig_3_calculate.py*, then *fig_3_draw.py*.\n\nTo recreate Fig. 4, run *fig_4.py*.\n\n=== FILES ===\n\n*demo.py:*\n  Contains a quick example of DEFT without boundary conditions in 1D. \n\n*deft_nobc.py:*\n\tContains primary functions for field theory density estimation in 1D without boundary conditions. \n\t\n*deft_utils.py*\n  Contains helper functions for field theory density estimation in 1D without boundary conditions.\n\n*fig_2.py:*\n\tPerforms computations for and plots Fig. 2. Saves as fig_2.pdf\n\t\n*fig_3_calculate.py:*\n\tPerforms computations for Fig. 3. Saves results in fig_3_20.pickle (for 20 simulations, not 100).\n\t\n*fig_3_draw.py:*\n\tDraws Fig. 3, saves as fig_3.pdf\n\t\n*fig_3.pickle:*\n\tContains results of simulations performed for fig_3.pdf\n  \n*fig_4.py:*\n\tDraws Fig. 4, saves as fig_4.pdf\n\n",
