Then, it gives the best method .o and auto-tuned parameters. \n    The project is multi-staged. It uses Lua as a high-level language and Terra as the low-level staged code. \n\n    requirements:\n        Terra (github.com/zdevito/terra)\n        Terra is a low-level language created with interoperability with Lua in mind. \n\n    running:\n        <terra binary> src/tuner.lua (it generates dconv.o or sconv.o)\n        You can run it as terra src/tuner.lua --help to see how it works and some flags or just see the code. \n        *Find the terra binary and run it or just make sure terra is in your $PATH or you have an alias to it\n        image test: use the makefile (summarily: terra src/imageconv.lua && ./my_convolution <kernel>)       Images are stored on /images.\n\n    most important branches: \n        -> Direct Method \n        -> Lowering (multi-threaded, using optimized GEMM))\n        State of the art of the method: http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.04343\n        -> FFT-based method (also called: \"Fast Convolution\") \n        Features: Multi-threaded, using: 2-points and 4-points FFT kernels, kernel for transpose  \n    and kernel for point-wise multiplication (blocked and auto-tuned)\n        State of the art of the method: http://arxiv.org/abs/1412.7580  \n    \n   \n    most important files: \n        src/tuner.lua: auto-tuner that iterates over the three methods \n        benchmarks/: benchmarking with other implementations\n        src/examples/: some minimal code of implemented features\n\n    libs:  \n        image.t:image library (from github.com/jameshegarty/darkroom)\n        <method>-matrixtestharness.t: time measure in the auto-tuning process\n        <method>-multithreads.t: multi-thread library based on pthreads\n        fft-kernels.t: n-point kernels for FFT\n\n    branching tags:\n      wip: works in progress\n      junk: experiments\n      bug: fixing a bug\n      dev: intermediate developments (to be put on tests/ folder) or with some specific feature\n    \n    tags:\n      v1.0\n\n    Note: the FFT-based has accuracy errors and the idea is to improve it and fix an upper-bound to round-off errors\n",
