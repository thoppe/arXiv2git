  "README.md": "# Old version of Caffe\nUse https://github.com/matthieudelaro/caffeBVLCplus instead, which has been updated from Caffe master in April 2016.\n\n# Fork of Caffe \n**This is a fork used for image reconstruction.**\n  0. Locally Connected Layers: downgraded from pull request https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/pull/3068\n  0. Unpool Layers, Deconvolution Layer : forked from https://github.com/HyeonwooNoh/caffe (based on original version of Caffe from January 2, 2015), which supports following architectures:\n    0. Deconvolution Network: **Learning Deconvolution Network for Semantic Segmentation** Hyeonwoo Noh, Seunghoon Hong, Bohyung Han [http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04366]\n    0.
