You can contribute, copy and distribute the content and code freely without restrictions. By contributing to the project you agree that your contributions abide by the same (lack of) rules.\n\n## Easy to Contribute\n\nThe data science dictionary is incredibly easy to contribute to - please contribute ! You can contribute to:\n\n1. The structure of the dictionary's [homepage](http://roopsmall.github.io/data-science-dictionary/). The html is in [index.html](https://github.com/roopsmall/data-science-dictionary/blob/gh-pages/index.html) but it is generated by [this python script]() so to contribute to the structure please contribute to [the python script]() which generates [index.html](https://github.com/roopsmall/data-science-dictionary/blob/gh-pages/index.html).\n2. The appearance of the dictionary's [homepage](http://roopsmall.github.io/data-science-dictionary/) which is determined by [this css file](https://github.com/roopsmall/data-science-dictionary/blob/gh-pages/stylesheet.css).\n3. The list of words which should appear in the dictionary. These are defined in [this meta-data file](link to file).\n3. The dictionary definitions for each of the terms in [this file]() each of which is defined in a separate file in [this folder]().\n\n## Contribution Guidelines\n\n1. Contributing to [generate-index-html.py]() should yield\n  * A clear and easy-to-use homepage\n  * All definitions 1 and/or 2 clicks away\n  * Good on desktop _and_ mobile\n\n2. Contributing to [stylesheet.css](https://github.com/roopsmall/data-science-dictionary/blob/gh-pages/stylesheet.css)\n  * A clear and easy-to-use homepage\n  * Clean, crisp syle which aids fast navigation\n  * Good on desktop _and_ mobile\n\n3. Contributing to the [list of words in the dictionary]()\n  * Terms should be those which appear frequently in machine learning and data science articles on ArXiv.org\n  * Terms should appear on ML subreddits, Quora ML questions/answers, Kaggle, Scikit-Learn Documentation and other data-science centric communities and blogs\n  * Terms should relate to ML concepts used in practice, not just theory \n\n4. Contributing to the [dictionary definitions]()\n  * Definitions need to be brief, complete and understandable to an ambitious, literate reader\n  * Definitions should include an equation _if necessary_ for the definition to be complete, generated by [latex2png](website)\n  * Where applicable, definitions should include links to Python and R packages which implement the algorithm\n",
