E, *Efficient Computation of Limit Spectra of Sample Covariance Matrices*, \nRandom Matrices: Theory Appl., 04, 1550019 (2015). http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.01649\n\n* This package is work in progress. Suggestions and comments are welcome. \nA MATLAB version is also available https://github.com/dobriban/EigenEdge/.\nThe latter is much more developed, and has a detailed documentation with examples.\nIn time, this R package should have more functionality added. \n\n",
