  "README": "A simple integer compression library for C/C++/Java\n=================\n\nOverview\n-----------\nReleased vpacker-0.1.0, which compresses a 32-bit or 64-bit\ninteger array. It is assumed to encode a sequence of integers\nwith highly positive skewness. The skewness is a distribution\nwhere the mass of the distribution is concentrated on the\nleft, i.e., an element of the sequence is rarely a large\ninteger. The main aspects of vpacker are;\n\n- Low heap requirements for compression & decompression\n- Fast decompression against legacy algorithms (e.g., gamma codes)\n- Optimize compression ratios by Dynamic Programming\n- Easy to use for C++; just include a header file\n\nFor example, your code just includes vpacker32.hpp for 32-bit\ninteger compression such as the following;\n\n----\n#include <vpacker32.hpp>\n\nint main() {\n  uint32_t  src[N];  /* src[N] stores N 32-bit integers */\n  char     *dst;     /* dst is a output buffer */\n\n  *dst = new char[vpacker32::CompressBound(N)];\n\n  size_t nwrite = vpacker32::Compress(src, dst, N);\n  /* nwrite is the number of written bytes in dst */\n\n  ...\n\n  uint32_t  orig[N];\n\n  vpacker32::Uncompress(dst, orig, N);\n\n  ...\n\n}\n\nIn case of 64-bit integers to compress, you need to include\nvpacker64.hpp. For C codes, you compile a shared library for\nvpacker, and include vpacker-c.h, and for Java, you need to\nuse vpacker via JNI (Java Native Interface).\n\nCurrently, vpacker is much slower than other state-of-the-art\ntechniques for integer compression according to a journal\n(http://arxiv.org/abs/1209.2137). However, this first release\nfocuses on low heap usages, usability, and portability.\nSome optimization techniques (architecture-aware designs and\nSIMD optimization) are future ToDo items for a next release.\n\n\nLicense\n-----------\nApache License, Version 2.0 http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0\n\n\nHistory\n-----------\n2013-02-24 version 0.1.0:\n* Basic functions implemented, and a first release.\n\n\nAuthors\n-----------\n* Takeshi Yamamuro, linguin.m.s_at_gmail.com\n\n",
