  "README.md": "# Quick-Neural-Art-Transfer\nTheano/Lasagne based Neural artistic style transfer with Kivy GUI\n\nbased on https://github.com/Lasagne/Recipes/tree/master/examples/styletransfer an implementation of the algorithm described in \"A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style\" (http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) by Gatys, Ecker and Bethge. \n\nuse VGG19 model http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/research/very_deep/\n(\n```wget https://s3.amazonaws.com/lasagne/recipes/pretrained/imagenet/vgg19_normalized.pkl ```\nto get the pickled file)\n\nSeveral modification are made to speed up the process. \n1. Doing the transfer in pyramid manner to speed up and seems generating better results.\n2. Has an option to use ADAM as the optimizer.\n3. Use shared memory and can precompile theanot functions. \n4. Has a server and a Kivy GUI client, so you can capture image using a mobile device and the use the GPU on a remote machine.\nUsage:\n```python\nimport neuralStyle as ns\nimport cv2\nns.precompute() # compile theano functions\nfor x in ns.p_transfer(\"photo.jpg\", \"art.jpg\"):\n  cv2.imshow(\"output\", x)\n```\n\nor you can use ```nstest.py photo.jpg art1.jpg art2.jpg art3.jpg``` to test it.\n\n## Demo program\n\nThe demo program with kivy UI is designed for an exhibition, which takes user's input from webcam and rendered it with a style.\n\nThe program expect an gpu of gtx 980 or better. To run this program, you will need a gpu at least as powerful as gtx 965m.\nIf your gpu is slower, than you will need to chang zmq.RCVTIMEO to  a larger value(more than 15 seconds)\nFirst run the server, \n```\npython nserver.py \n```\nyou will need to wait a while it for theano function to be compiled, it may take up to 2 minutes.\nThen you can run the kivy client. it requires a webcam and cv2 installed.\nThen you can run the client\n```\npython main.py\n```\nCurrently, all messages are in Chinese.\n\n\n\ncontent and styles\nMany image files are from https://github.com/jcjohnson/neural-style and some are public domain\n\nCC-By  http://agf81.deviantart.com/art/Ivy-Texture-7-326197006?q=gallery%3ACreative-Commons%2F26171837&qo=33\nIvy texture\n\nCC-BY-SA   http://maadmann.deviantart.com/art/Fullcolor-437966862?q=gallery%3ACreative-Commons%2F26171826&qo=88\nfullcolor\n\nCC-BY https://www.flickr.com/photos/fontplaydotcom/24795772945/in/pool-734017@N25/\ncolor squares\n\nCCB-BY-SA \nhttp://oilsoaked.deviantart.com/art/holiday-188505340?q=gallery%3ACreative-Commons%2F26171826&qo=373\nHolidy\n\nCC-BY\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/two/236883835/in/photolist-mW6j4-mW6kn-Jy6XP-Jy9fR-JxQD8-mW6gp-JxQGc-Jy5Xf-Jy3ES-mW6fr-Jy9eM-mW6hW-JxQqD-JxMdm-mW6nF-JxQtD-JxQxR-mW6mA-JxLZS-Jy72p-JxM2N-Jy3Hh-JxLU7-JxLWb-JxQsz-oH3ixB-4Nri37-JxQJr-JxQFe-Jy3AY-JxMcq-Jy3xG-JxQvT-Jy95i-Jy99n-JxQz2-a97MmE-JxQm6-Jy5V5-a97Nqb-a97PVu-Jy97c-a94ZyK-ADmwE6-B3g6KV-ADmtTV-BysQ61-a97Ptd-a94Zex-dwVdG\nndhu\n\nCC-BY\nhttps://www.flickr.com/photos/jphotos/5998521863/in/photolist-mW6gp-JxQGc-Jy5Xf-Jy3ES-mW6fr-Jy9eM-mW6hW-JxQqD-JxMdm-mW6nF-JxQtD-JxQxR-mW6mA-JxLZS-Jy72p-JxM2N-Jy3Hh-JxLU7-JxLWb-JxQsz-oH3ixB-4Nri37-JxQJr-JxQFe-Jy3AY-JxMcq-Jy3xG-JxQvT-Jy95i-Jy99n-JxQz2-a97MmE-JxQm6-Jy5V5-a97Nqb-a97PVu-Jy97c-a94ZyK-ADmwE6-B3g6KV-ADmtTV-BysQ61-a97Ptd-a94Zex-dwVdG-fJCm8H-ih4o2w-farbgP-ez8gpV-a244iL\nndhu2\n\nCC-BY https://www.flickr.com/photos/kurtbudiarto/7257851556/in/photolist-c4mopE-jZZkdx-8bohuZ-bjLvVe-c4wRru-gkp48t-hPNbbL-qfySJz-c84E3h-fBV6ve-aijVu7-fCaHPs-qZ7XnX-f8zn77-eQRUQ5-695MbG-dQNbTm-rowN34-6o4FFz-d3MjtL-9htwN2-r6Yib1-fCau8q-fCaCh9-551xgk-bkueEX-fBVtqt-pbJvac-fCbdY9-aRQ2oH-oUai6n-fCbaRs-fKzB9m-fCbmqA-7kBUGU-eX5Ce9-fBVu9x-ftqE1w-aihyDg-bku5n4-54rawt-nixm7H-dDjykx-55JGBX-c4mnWy-bkudkH-pRMC8L-55JGWa-5A9m5g-6uijiE/\nsmile face\n",
