  "README.md": "# Data-dependent initialization of convolutional neural networks\n\nCreated by Philipp Krahenbuhl.\n\n### Introduction\n\nThis code implements the initialization presented in our [arXiv tech report](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06856), which is under submission at ICLR 2016.\n\n*This is a reimplementation and currently work in progress. Use at your own risk.*\n\n### License\n\nThis code is released under the BSD License (refer to the LICENSE file for details).\n\n### Citing\n\nIf you find our initialization useful in your research, please consider citing:\n\n    @article{krahenbuhl2015data,\n      title={Data-dependent Initializations of Convolutional Neural Networks},\n      author={Kr{\\\"a}henb{\\\"u}hl, Philipp and Doersch, Carl and Donahue, Jeff and Darrell, Trevor},\n      journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.06856},\n      year={2015}\n    }\n\n### Setup\n\nCheckout the project and create a symlink to caffe in the `magic_init` directory:\n```Shell\nln -s path/to/caffe/python/caffe caffe\n```\n\n### Examples\n\nHere is a quick example on how to initialize alexnet:\n```bash\npython magic_init.py path/to/alexnet/deploy.prototxt path/to/output.caffemodel -d \"path/to/some/images/*.png\" -q -nit 10 -cs\n```\nHere ```-d``` flag allows you to initialize the network using your own images. Feel free to use imagenet, Pascal, COCO or whatever you have at hand, it shouldn't make a big difference. The ```-q``` (queit) flag suppresses all the caffe logging, ```-nit``` controls the number of batches used (while ```-bs``` controls the batch size). Finally ```-cs``` rescales the gradients accross layers. This rescaling currently works best for feed-forward networks, and might not work too well for DAG structured networks (we are working on that).\n\nTo run the k-means initialization use:\n```bash\npython magic_init.py path/to/alexnet/deploy.prototxt path/to/output.caffemodel -d \"path/to/some/images/*.png\" -q -nit 10 -cs -t kmeans\n```\n\nFinally, ```python magic_init.py -h``` should provide you with more help.\n\n\n### Pro tips\nIf you're numpy implementation is based on openblas, try disabeling threading ```export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1```, it can improve the runtime performance a bit.\n",
