  "README.md": "# findHomology\n\nProgram used to compute rational homology groups for the following article: http://arxiv.org/abs/0808.0739 .\n\nAs input we take a text file containing a collection of same sized subsets of the positive integers. Each separated with a 0 and a -1 to denote the end of that collection.\n\nFor example: 1 2 0 3 4 0 5 6 -1\n\nThe program will then form a simplicial complex using this data where the vertices are the subsets and we form an N-1 simplex whenever N subsets have a nonempty intersection. By using the Linbox library to compute ranks of boundary matrices, we determine the rational homology groups.\n",
