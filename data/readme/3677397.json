  "README": "====================\nPerl science scripts\n====================\n\nThis is a repository of Perl scripts I wrote and used in scientific research, principally in the period from 2002 - 2006, before switching to Python. Even though I switched, I haven't reimplemented them, and still use them in my work.\n\nIndex\n=====\n\n* arXivtools\n* trim\n\narXivtools\n==========\n\nA pair of scripts that parse the daily arXiv RSS feed based on configuration file supplied science keywords. They both work by reading in (separate) configs and the arXiv XML, then scoring articles based on keyword occurence in the abstracts of the articles. The output is written to an HTML file.\n\nThe two scripts have slightly different uses: arXivFilter is for doing personal searches based on keywords and scores, arXivVoyeur is for use by research groups, for assigning papers to different people based on expertise.\n\nExample configuration files for the two scripts are also provided, as is the list of AAS approved scientific keywords commonly used in papers.\n\nExample invocation: arXivVoyeur --config=conffile --output=outfile [--debug]\n\nSee also this blog post for discussion: http://letterstonature.wordpress.com/2008/11/21/arxiv-filtering/\n\ntrim\n====\n\nJust a simple alternative for the *nix `cut` tool, which I have used countless times to pull columns from a catalogue of astronomical objects in ascii format. One day, relational databases will replace ascii files as the pre-eminent distribution format for catalogues of objects.\n\nUntil then, use: trim filename [col numbers] [> outfile]\n\nColumn numbers start at one, because I was writing more Fortran than C at the time this script emerged.\n",
