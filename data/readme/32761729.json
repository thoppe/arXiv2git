  "README.md": "Presentation openscienceASAP meets DIY-Biolab Montreal\n==============================\n \n- Date: Saturday, 14. March 2015\n- Location: Google Hangout On Air\n- Language: English\n\n**Content**\n- [Slideshare](http://de.slideshare.net/cheeseman1983/open-sciencebiohackers)\n- [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxCb0GfEXIU)\n\n## FACTS\nAudience: Bio-Hackers\n\n### Goal\n- Show use of openness\n- inspire with idea of open science\n- create interest in the idea\n- tell basic gap in trainings on universities\n- show power of connecting open science with citizen science\n- connecting: Open Knowledge, openscienceASAP\n\n### Schedule\n- Welcome 2min\n- Introduction Open Science 20min \n- Biology and Open Science 5min\n- openscienceASAP 5min \n- Q&A 25min \nSUM: 60min\n\n## PRESENTATION\n\n### Slide 1: Welcome\n**Relaxed entry**\n\n- Thanks for invitation, hello to the internet\n- name & origin, DIY/hacker roots, \n- openscienceASAP: do trainings and offer blogs\n- Open Knowledge: Open Science Community coordinator, volunteer, international network, [Canada](http://ca.okfn.org/)\n\n### Slide 2: Details Hangout\n**Show easy going style and experimental, non-expert status and schedule**\n\n- non-expert: farm, weakest field, started my interest via youtube video about DIY bio-scene\n- experimental: first time live stream, not an expert in biology, hard to estimate your knowledge and interests. slides and recordings will be online afterwards. \n- structure: \n\t- 20min introduction open science (basic overview of the idea and actual discourse)\n\t- 5min basic overview for bio-hackers\n\t- 5min openscienceASAP\n\t- 30min Q&A (hashtag, tweet, comments, chat, \n\n### Slide 3: Open Science\n**What does the term Open Science mean?**\n\n- no definition\n- Open Science is better science\n\n### Slide 4: What is this Open?\n**Ask: \"What is this open?\"**\n\n### Slide 5: Open Definition\n**Explain the Open Definition as the central principle**\n\n- no license\n- all, also commercial\n- why: interoperability, easy to use\n- Knowledge / Content: audio, books, images, data, code, etc.\n\n### Slide 6: What does this mean for Science?\n**Ask the question \"What does this mean for science?\"**\n\n- science != wissenschaft\n\n### Slide 7: 6 Principles\n**Show the six principles**\n\n- defined by kraker and me\n\n### Slide 8: Open Access\n**Open the scientific publications.**\n\n- heavily discussed\n- psoitions are clear: publishers want to keep the control, internet offers new ways of organizing and distribution knowledge\n\n### Slide 9: Open Data\n**Open your reserach data**\n\n- raw and final data\n- dataformats\n\n### Slide 10: Open Source\n**Open your software**\n\n- created and used\n- most successfull, heavily used (android, linux, server,)\n\n### Slide 11: Open Methodology\n**Open up the research process**\n\n- also called open notebook science\n- most radical and exciting principle\n- blog\n- github\n- document with videos the experiment (setup, procedure)\n- share protocols\n\n### Slide 12: Open Peer Review\n**Open the quality assurance process**\n\n- heavily discussed right now\n- double blinded or with real names\n- examples: allow comments, better \n\n### Slide 13: Open Educational Resources\n**Open up the learning material**\n\n- share educational materials\n\n### Slide 14: Wholistic approach\n**All principles together are real open science**\n\n### Slide 15: Why?\n**Ask \"Why Open Science?\"**\n\n- use of knowledge by EVERYONE\n- easy access = more citations\n- faster dissemination\n- reproducible, fraud\n- foundation for collaboration and interdisciplinary work\n- cause it goes: www, pc's, software tools, programming languages, \n- more efficient, less redundances\n\n### Slide 16: Open Science for Bio-Hackers\n**Start next section: Open Science for Bio-Hackers**\n\n- slides will be online later on\n- also notes on github\n- collection of projects which looks most relevant and open \n- not complete\n\n### Slide 17: Community\n**Show actors in the Open Science / Biology community**\n\n### Slide 18: Open Source\n**Show open source tools for bio-hackers**\n\n- etherpads: early conceptual/brainstorming phase, group of people working simultaniously\n- git + github: very important, versioning of line-based files\n- r + python as example for programming languages\n\n### Slide 19: Open Data Formats\n**Genome sequencing data formats**\n\n### Slide 20: Open Data Repositories\n**Share repositories**\n\n- two groups: repositories where bio-hackers can share data and repositories with data offered from institutions\n\n### Slide 21: Open Access Journals\n**Most important Open Access Journals**\n\n- PLOS is huge, PLOS ONE and other specialized journals\n- eLife: Editor Randy Shekmann (Nobel Prize winner)\n- bioRxiv = Pre-Print server (sibling to arxiv.org)\n\n### Slide 22: Open Access Collaborative Writing\n**How to write collaborativly**\n\n### Slide 23: Open Methodology\n**Open Notebook Science**\n\n### Slide 24: openscienceASAP\n**Intro Slide**\n\n### Slide 25: Community\n**Build a community**\n\n- Organize hackathons\n- Monthly Open Science Sum-Up (german)\n- Podcast (german)\n\n### Slide 26: Blogging\n**Offer Blogs for Open Science Blogger**\n\n- we offer everyone a free blog as a subdomain for openscienceasap.org. Only requirement: use by default a OpenDefinition compatible license for the content and write about Science - most likely about open scientific practices.\n\n### Slide 27: Training\n**Train students open scientific practices**\n\n- we go into Universities and scholarly communities to educate about Open Science\n\n### Slide 28: End\n**Last slide**\n\n- Thanks\n- get in touch\n- happy for your questions\n\n### Slide 29: Sources & References I\n\n### Slide 30: Sources & References II\n\n### Slide 31: Sources & References III\n\n",
