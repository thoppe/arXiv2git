Currently features the following two programs:\r\n\r\nAlignDistCalc is a program for mass-evaluation of test alignments against a reference. It supports standard FASTA files and StatAlign mpd/log files both as test and reference.\r\n\r\nAlignDistSample takes samples approximately uniformly from the set of alignments that are at a given distance from a reference alignment. It uses the Metropolis coupled MCMC (parallel tempering) technique to allow efficient sampling. Also features a temperature tuning mode where chain temperatures are automatically adjusted to meet the prescribed chain swap acceptance ratios.\r\n\r\nThe alignment distance measure in use by these tools are defined in the paper:\r\nSchwartz et al. (2005) Alignment Metric Accuracy, arXiv:q-bio/0510052\r\n\r\n\r\n### USAGE ###\r\n\r\nTo get help:\r\n\r\njava -jar adcalc.jar -h\r\njava -jar adsample.jar -h\r\n\r\n\r\nExample (typical) usage:\r\n\r\n1. AlignDistCalc\r\n\r\njava -jar adcalc.jar ref.fsa test1.fsa test2.fsa\r\n\r\n2.
