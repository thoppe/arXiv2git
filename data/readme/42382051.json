Frustrated by\nthe experience of reading two-column journal articles on your Kindle e-reader?\n\nIf you happen to own a [Kindle\nDX](http://www.amazon.com/Kindle-DX-Wireless-Reader-3G-Global/dp/B002GYWHSQ)\ndevice, and happen to be an avid [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/) reader, Kindlize\nwill make reading arXiv pre-prints on e-ink screen as pleasant as on A4 papers!\n\nThe idea is simple. arXiv usually keeps the LaTeX source file of uploaded\nmanuscripts, and Kindlize will reformat and recompile those LaTeX files so\nthat the new pdf file is Kindle-friendly.\n\n_CAVEAT_\n\nCurrently Kindlize only works with `astro-ph` posts on arXiv, but it could\nbe easily adapted to other fields by adding LaTeX style files for relevant\njournals. Please let me know if you want to work on implementing Kindlize\nfor fields outside of Astrophysics.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n-----------\n\n### Before (pure text and equations)\n\n![Screenshot](http://bitbucket.org/nye17/kindlize/raw/default/screenshots/textpage_before_small_framed.png)\n\n\n### After (pure text and equations)\n\n![Screenshot](http://bitbucket.org/nye17/kindlize/raw/default/screenshots/textpage_after_small_framed.png)\n\n\n### Before (with Figure)\n\n![Screenshot](http://bitbucket.org/nye17/kindlize/raw/default/screenshots/figpage_before_small_framed.png)\n\n### After (with Figure)\n\n![Screenshot](http://bitbucket.org/nye17/kindlize/raw/default/screenshots/figpage_after_small_framed.png)\n\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\n* python2.7\n* a LaTeX environment\n* rsync\n* [Dropbox](http://db.tt/i5xwlaj9) (suggested)\n* GNU Make\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nIf you have [mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com) installed, clone\nthe source\n\n    $ hg clone ssh://hg@bitbucket.org/nye17/kindlize \n\notherwise you can download tarball from\n[here](https://bitbucket.org/nye17/kindlize/downloads), then\n    \n    $ tar zxvf kindlize-0.1.0.tar.gz\n\nto de-compress under your current directory.\n\nTo install,\n\n    $ cd kindlize\n    $ python setup.py install\n\nor if you want to install to a specified directory `INSTALLDIR`\n\n    $ python setup.py install --prefix=INSTALLDIR\n\n\nWorkflow\n--------\n\nIt is useful to explain the ideal workflow using Kindlize. There are three\nmajor goals I want to achieve for a hassle-free reading experience:\n\n* Converting the source tarball downloaded from arXiv server into Kindle-friendly pdf for any arXiv-id.\n* Maintaining a local directory of \"kindlized\" pdfs among multiple computers (using Dropbox).\n* Synchronizing your Kindle arXiv content to the local directory on your computer. \n\nKindlize is designed to take care of all three goals, with some help from\nDropbox (simply by storing your local copy of kindlized pdfs inside your\nDropbox directory).\n\nHowever, before typing `kindlize` on your terminal, you need to configurate\nKindlize first. Let's get started!\n\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nObviously, Kindlize needs to understand the filesystems of both your computer\nand Kindlize device - like, where to put temporary files during compiling, where\nto put kindlized pdfs on your computer and on your Kindle, etc. For this\npurpose, Kindlize needs to read a configuration file under your home directory\n`~/.kindle.cfg`. You can modify the `example.cfg` file that comes with the\nsource package and copy it to your local home directory,\n\n    $ copy example.cfg ~/.kindle.cfg\n\nand tailor it to your own needs. The required items in `~/.kindle.cfg` are\n\n## [general]\n\n### device=Kindle DX\n\nCurrently Kindlize only serves the Kindle DX device, as other Kindle versions\nare too small for serious journal reading. But if you want to give it a shot,\nplease let me know (I don't personally own other Kindles, so I may need your\nhelp on tests).\n\n## [directory]\n\n### tmpDir=~/tmp\n\nDetermines where the TeX file will be unpacked and compiled into pdfs. A\nstandard `tmp` directory would be ideal.\n\n### dropDir=~/Dropbox/kindle_sync/\n\nDetermines where on your local directory you want to store a backup of your\nKindlized pdfs. Here I put it as a subdirectry within my Dropbox folder,\nso that I could select and process the desired pdfs on my office machine,\nthen sync and update my Kindle using my home computer later. You need to\ncreate `dropDir` on your computer manually.\n\n### mountDir=/media/Kindle/\n\nThe mount point of your Kindle device. You have to make sure that `mountDir` is\nwritable by your user account.\n\n### incomingDir=/media/Kindle/documents/Incoming/\n\nTells Kindlize where your Kindle content will show up in your file system\n(i.e., the `/media/Kindle` part, which should be the same as `mountDir`) \nand which subdirectory you want to store the\narXiv files (i.e., the `documents/Incoming` part). Note that `incomingDir`\nwill always be synced to `dropDir`. You also need to create `incomingDir`\non your Kindle manually.\n\n## [LaTeX]\n\n### font=charter\n\nDetermines which LaTeX font package to use for pdfs. You have\nto make sure they are available in your LaTeX environment - place\n`\\usepackage{YOUR_CHOICE_OF_FONT}` in your test LaTeX file and compile.\n\n### fontheight=14pt\n\nDetermines the height of your fonts.\n\n### fontwidth=18pt\n\nDetermines the baseline of your fonts.\n\n## [pdf]\n\n### pdfviewer=mupdf\n\nDetermines which pdf viewer to preview the generated pdfs on your computer. `mupdf` is\nstrongly recommended.\n \n\nUsage\n-----\n\nTo kindlize an arXiv article, simply do\n\n    $ kindlize 1211.1379 astrocoffee\n\nwhere [`1211.1379`](http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.1379) is the arXiv identifier for\nthe paper you want to read, and `astrocoffee` is the name of the subdirectory\nyou want to keep this file under your `dropDir` and `incomingDir`. If you\ndon't want to bother with organizing your pdfs, simply substitute `astrocoffee`\nwith `.`.\n\nAs indicated by `example.cfg`, I have created a local directory\n`~/Dropbox/kindle_sync/` as my `dropDir` for storing kindlized pdfs, so that\nthe reformated pdf (turns out to be, _accidentally_, `Zu12.pdf`) will go into\n`~/Dropbox/kindle_sync/astrocoffee` directory.\n\nThe above command will also enable you to preview the kindlized pdf using\nyour favorite `pdfviewer`.\n\nI have also created a new directory under Kindle `documents/incoming/` as my\n`incomingDir` to synchronize to the `~/Dropbox/kindle_sync/` directory on\nmy computer. To synchronize, simply plug in your Kindle and make sure that\nthe Kindle filesystem is accessible (e.g., in my case, `/media/Kindle/`\nexists.), then run\n\n    $ kindlize\n\nwithout arguments. This will force the Kindle `incomingDir` directory to\nbe exactly the same as your local `dropDir` directory (i.e., files could\nbe either added or deleted from your Kindle!). This command will also send\nthe newly added pdfs to the right `collection` on your Kindle. For example,\n`Zu12.pdf` file will appear in the `incoming - astrocoffee` collection,\nhowever, you have to reboot your Kindle to see the new `collection` in action ;-(.\n\n\nYou can always type\n\n    $ kindlize -h\n\nfor help.\n\n\nAnd last, enjoy reading!\n\n\nContributing\n------------\n\nKindlize is licensed under GNU GPL, and you are welcome to modify and use the\ncode for your own purpose. Please, report bugs and issues as I won't be able to\ncover all the TeX formats on arXiv.
