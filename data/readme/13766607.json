  "readme": "This toolbox implements the code to generate the figure of the article:\n\nVincent Duval and Gabriel Peyre, \"Exact Support Recovery for Sparse Spikes Deconvolution\"\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1306.6909\n\nIt implements the resolution of the sparse spike deconvolution over measure following the method introduced by Candes and Fernandez-Granda. It also implements the computation of various dual pre-certificates. When these pre-certificate assume values in [-1,1], they are valid certificate and garantees the identifiability of an atomic measure, and also possibly some robustness to noise. \n\nIt requires the CVX toolbox to be installed to work properly.\n\n-- List of scripts --\ntest_path.m: test the resolution of the Lasso over measure using the SDP lifting.\ntest_certificates.m: first main contribution of the paper, display the various pre-certificates.\ntest_discrete.m: second main contribution of the paper, comparison of the discrete and continuous problems. \ntest_proximal.m : test the resolution of the dual problem using DR proximal splitting. \n\n-- List of functions --\ncompute_certificate.m: compute various pre-certificates\nkernel.m: [should not be used, depreciated] compute various kernels\nload_diracs.m: loads various input measures for tests.\nperform_lasso.m: solve the finite dimensional L^1 discrete regularization (and its dual)\nperform_sdp_dual.m: solve the dual problem of the blasso (Lasso over measures) \nperform_sdp_superresolution.m: solve the primal problem by root finding after solving the primal one.\nplot_certificates.m: helper function for the display of the pre-certificates.\nload_helpers.m: load a few helper function for Fourier transform and measurements.\n\ntoolbox/ contains useful functions.\n\nCopyright (c) 2013 Gabriel Peyre",
