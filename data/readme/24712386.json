Rep. 5, 13584; doi: 10.1038/srep13584 (2015)](http://www.nature.com/articles/srep13584).\n\nSome usage examples can be found in the accompanying ipython-notebook `code/demo.ipynb`; a static view is available [here](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/eldad-a/ridge-directed-ring-detector/blob/master/code/demo.ipynb);\n\nAn easy way to get the required dependencies is using [Anaconda](http://continuum.io/downloads), which is cross-platform, or any other Python distribution which includes [Cython](http://cython.org/), [Scipy](http://cython.org/) and [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/).\n\nAcknowledgements would be highly appreciated; for academic citation please use:\n\nAfik, E.
