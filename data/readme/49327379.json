  "README.md": "# ExpoMF\nThis repository contains the source code to reproduce all the experimental results as described in the paper [\"Modeling User Exposure in Recommendation\"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.07025) (WWW'16).\n\n## Dependencies\nThe python module dependencies are:\n- numpy/scipy\n- scikit.learn\n- joblib\n- bottleneck\n- pandas (needed to run the example for data preprocessing)\n\n**Note**: The code is mostly written for Python 2.7. For Python 3.x, it is still usable with minor modification. If you run into any problem with Python 3.x, feel free to contact me and I will try to get back to you with a helpful solution.  \n\n## Datasets\n- [Taste Profile Subset](http://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/tasteprofile)\n- [Gowalla](https://snap.stanford.edu/data/loc-gowalla.html): the pre-processed data that we used in the paper can be downloaded [here](http://dawenl.github.io/data/gowalla_pro.zip).\n\nWe also used the arXiv and Mendeley dataset in the paper. However, these datasets are not publicly available. With Taste Profile Subset and Gowalla, we can still cover all the different variations of the model presented in the paper. \n\nWe used the weighted matrix factorization (WMF) implementation in [content_wmf](https://github.com/dawenl/content_wmf) repository. \n\n## Examples\nSee example notebooks in `src/`. \n",
