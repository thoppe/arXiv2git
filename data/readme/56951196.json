  "README.md": "<<<<<<< HEAD\n# NeuralNetworkStudy\n=======\n# Bayesian Optimization\n\nPure Python implementation of bayesian global optimization with gaussian processes.\n\n    pip install git+https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization.git\n\nThis is a constrained global optimization package built upon bayesian inference and gaussian process, that attempts to find the maximum value of an unknown function in as few iterations as possible. This technique is particularly suited for optimization of high cost functions, situations where the balance between exploration and exploitation is important.\n\nCheckout this [notebook](https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization/blob/master/examples/visualization.ipynb) with a step by step visualization of how this method works.\n\n![BayesianOptimization in action](https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization/blob/master/examples/bo_example.png)\n\nCheckout the [examples](https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization/tree/master/examples) folder for more scripts with examples of how to use this package.\n\n![BayesianOptimization in action](https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization/blob/master/examples/bayesian_optimization.gif)\n\nInstallation\n============\n\n### Installation\n\nBayesianOptimization is not currently available on the PyPi's reporitories, \nhowever you can install it via `pip`:\n\n    pip install git+https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization.git\n\nIf you prefer, you can clone it and run the setup.py file. Use the following commands to get a \ncopy from Github and install all dependencies:\n\n    git clone https://github.com/fmfn/BayesianOptimization.git\n    cd BayesianOptimization\n    python setup.py install\n\n### Dependencies\n* Numpy\n* Scipy\n* Scikit-learn\n\nDisclaimer: This project is under active development, if you find a bug, or anything that needs correction, please let me know.\n\n### References:\n* http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4522-practical-bayesian-optimization-of-machine-learning-algorithms.pdf\n* http://arxiv.org/pdf/1012.2599v1.pdf\n* http://www.gaussianprocess.org/gpml/\n* https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vz3D36VXefI&index=10&list=PLE6Wd9FR--EdyJ5lbFl8UuGjecvVw66F6\n>>>>>>> 7e1c7abcdfcfd57be947b0ceda135167f0c64b4c\n",
