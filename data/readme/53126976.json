  "README.md": "# Model Selection with Stepwise Regression\n\nWhile no model selection criteria is perfect, making use of the avaliable statistical\ntools allows a researcher to systematically choose a set of predictive variables for a \ngiven set of data and critiria.  The selection process can be done by an autmoatic \nprocedure in the form of a sequence of tests such as F-tests or making use of the \nAkaike information criterion.\n\n\"The most that can be expected from any model is that it can  supply a useful approximation to reality: All models are wrong; some models are useful\". -- [George Box](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_E._P._Box)\n\n## Requirements\n\n- [R](https://www.r-project.org/): environment for statistical computing and graphics\n- [car](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/car/): Companion to Applied Regression\n- [gplot](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gplots/index.html): Various R Programming Tools for Plotting Data\n\n## References\n\n- D.
