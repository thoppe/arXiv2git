  "README": "arXiv\n\nThe README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on\nhow to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for\nexample C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information\nthat should be provided before the module is installed.\n\nA README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the README\nfile from a module distribution so that people browsing the archive\ncan use it to get an idea of the module's uses. It is usually a good idea\nto provide version information here so that people can decide whether\nfixes for the module are worth downloading.\n\n\nINSTALLATION\n\nTo install this module, run the following commands:\n\n\tperl Makefile.PL\n\tmake\n\tmake test\n\tmake install\n\nSUPPORT AND DOCUMENTATION\n\nAfter installing, you can find documentation for this module with the\nperldoc command.\n\n    perldoc arXiv\n\nYou can also look for information at:\n\n    RT, CPAN's request tracker\n        http://rt.cpan.org/NoAuth/Bugs.html?Dist=arXiv\n\n    AnnoCPAN, Annotated CPAN documentation\n        http://annocpan.org/dist/arXiv\n\n    CPAN Ratings\n        http://cpanratings.perl.org/d/arXiv\n\n    Search CPAN\n        http://search.cpan.org/dist/arXiv/\n\n\nLICENSE AND COPYRIGHT\n\nCopyright (C) 2010 arXiv.org\n\nThis program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it\nunder the terms of either: the GNU General Public License as published\nby the Free Software Foundation; or the Artistic License.\n\nSee http://dev.perl.org/licenses/ for more information.\n\n",
