It's pretty much my favorite.  I usually have it deliver me quotes from Star Trek or something, I think I found something even better.\n\nThis repository contains all of the titles and urls of papers hosted on [arXiv.org](http://www.arxiv.org), neatly arranged and ready to be displayed.  If you are feeling particularly data-futzy and don't want to wait a day to scrape the data yourself, you also get access to all of the metadata for all of the papers on that site.\n\n## How do I use it?\n\nAll you really need is the `arxiv_fortunes.txt` file and the `arxiv_fortunes.txt.dat` file to be in the same directory. Then tell fortune to do it's thing.  You don't actually need any of the other files, but they are nice to have if you want to do your own project with them.  That's a lot of metadata going to waste if you don't.\n\n    git clone git@github.com:swirepe/arXiv-fortunes.git ~/.arxiv\n    cd ~/.arxiv\n    echo  \"Now removing the things you don't need.\"\n    rm -i arxiv.tar.xz\n    rm -i getArxiv.py\n    rm -i parseArxiv.py\n    unxz arxiv_fortunes.txt.xz\n    fortune .\n\nThen add this to your .bashrc, to have a fortune show up on new shell creation.\n\n\n    if [ $[ ( $RANDOM % 100 ) ] -lt  40 ]\n    then\n        fortune ~/.arxiv\n    fi\n\n\n[That will display a fortune 40% of the time.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement#Intermittent_reinforcements)  As it stands, those fortunes come out in color.\n\n## Examples\n\n    [ math ]\n    http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.6576\n\n    Orderability, contact non-squeezing, and Rabinowitz Floer homology\n\nOr\n\n    [ physics:gr-qc ]\n    http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/0208028\n\n    Possible time variations of G in scalar-tensor theories of gravity\n\nOr\n\n    [ physics:hep-lat ]\n    http://arxiv.org/abs/hep-lat/9503018\n\n    Cooling and the SU(2) Instanton Vaccuum\n\nOr \n\n    [ cs ]\n    http://arxiv.org/abs/1011.2836\n\n    System Virtualization and Efficient ID Transmission Method for RFID Tag Infrastructure Network\n\n\nEnjoy!\n",
