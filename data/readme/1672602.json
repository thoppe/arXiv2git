  "README": "N-sample v0.1\nAuthor: Michael D. Schneider\n\nCode to add new large-scale Fourier mode realizations to an N-body simulation that \nwas run without any large-scale power.\n\nThis version is not intended to readily compile on other systems, but matches the code version used \nfor the publication below.\n\n\nPlease cite the following paper in any publications resulting from use of this code:\nM. D. Schneider, S. Cole, C. S. Frenk, and I. Szapudi, \"Fast generation of ensembles of cosmological N-body simulations via mode-resampling,\" arXiv, 2011.\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1103.2767\n\n\nSee the LICENSE file for terms of use and redistribution of the source code and documentation.\n\n\nDependencies (must be separately downloaded):\n\n- FFTW (http://www.fftw.org/)\nv2.1.5 is required for the MPI functionality.  For serial runs, FFTW v3.2.2 is also supported.\nIf the compiler flags -DFFTW and -DMPI are both omitted then the code will compile with \nFFT from the Sun Performance Library.  The routines in fft_nsample.f90 need to be changed \nfor other FFT options in this case.\n\n- FITPACK (http://www.netlib.org/fitpack/index.html)\nCompile without the flag -DFITPACK to remove this dependency.  Log-linear interpolation of the \ntheory power spectrum is used instead of splines in this case.\nInterface blocks for the necessary FITPACK routines are included io_nsample.f90 in this package.\n\n- read_millennium Routines by John Helly, ICC Durham.  These routines are not publicly available \nso the user of this software will need to replace the functionality for reading their own\nN-body snapshot files.",
