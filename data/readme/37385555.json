  "README.md": "## General purpose HNC code\n\nThe current stable release is version 1.6.  Previous versions can be\nfound at http://sunlightdpd.sourceforge.net/.  Version 1.6 can be\nfound by clicking on the 'release' tab at the top of the file listing.\n\nVersion 1.7 handles an arbitrary number of components (rather than a\nmaximum of three, as for previous versions).  In the present\ndevelopment snapshot, the documentation is up to date and the code is\nfully functioning but should be regarded as being in 'beta testing'.\n\n#### Features\n\n* FORTRAN 90 based, with example python driver scripts ;\n* fast Ng solver, and Ng decomposition for electrostatics ;\n* multicomponent (arbitrary number of components) ;\n* hard and soft core (DPD) potentials ;\n* full structural thermodynamics ;\n* fully open source.\n\nSee [PDF documentation](oz_doc.pdf \"oz_doc.pdf\") for details.\n\n#### Citation\n\nYou are of course welcome to use and modify this code for your own\nprojects. If you end up publishing results based on this code, or a\nderived version, please cite :\n\n*Screening properties of Gaussian electrolyte models, with application\nto dissipative particle dynamics,* P.

A basic Makefile is\nprovided.  The code is designed to be run from python using the `f2py`\ninterface from [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/ \"SciPy website\"), though\nsome examples of 'vanilla' FORTRAN 90 driver codes are included.  The\ndefault target in the `Makefile` builds the required files for the\n`f2py` interface.\n\nThe [LAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/ \"LAPACK webpage\")\nlinear algebra library and [FFTW](http://www.fftw.org/ \"FFTW website\")\nfast Fourier transform library are both required.\n\nThe compiler tools including `f2py`, and pre-built versions of the\n`lapack` and `fftw` libraries, are available for most modern GNU/Linux\ndistributions.\n\n#### Copying\n\nSunlightHNC is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nSunlightHNC is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but\nWITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
