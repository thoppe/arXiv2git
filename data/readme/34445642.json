  "README.md": "![alt text](https://github.com/scarrazza/smpdf/raw/master/extra/logo.png \"Logo\")\n\nSpecialized Minimal PDFs tools.\n\n##Citation\n\nIf you use this code in your publication, please cite:\n\n*Specialized minimal PDFs for optimized LHC\ncalculations* [http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00005](http://arxiv.org/abs/1602.00005) \n\n##Existing results\n\nThe compressed sets quoted in the paper above can be found here:\n\n<http://pcteserver.mi.infn.it/~nnpdf/smpdf_output/>\n\n\nThe APPLGrids used to generate these sets can be found here:\n\n<http://pcteserver.mi.infn.it/~nnpdf/smpdf-applgrids/>\n\n## Download\n\nClone the master development repository by running the following command:\n\n```Shell\n$ git clone https://github.com/scarrazza/smpdf.git\n```\n\nOr download the compressed archive without using git\n[here](https://github.com/scarrazza/smpdf/archive/master.zip).\n\n## Installation\n\nSMPDF requires [APPlgrid](https://applgrid.hepforge.org/) and\n[LHAPDF](https://lhapdf.hepforge.org/). Make sure the following commands can be\nexecuted and give valid results:\n\n````Shell\n$ lhapdf-config\n$ applgrid-config\n```\nThe default Applgrid installation **will not work**: **All** header files must \nbe copied to the appromiate include path, and not only those copied by\n`make install`, which is insufficient. For example, for a default\nUbuntu installation:\n\n````Shell\napplgrid-1.4.70/src $ sudo cp *.h /usr/local/include/appl_grid/\n````\n\nPython 3.4+ is also required.\n\nIn order to manage the Python dependencies,\n[Anaconda](https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda/) (with a Python  \n3.4+ environment) is the recommended way. After setting it up,\ncd into the directory of SMPDF and:\n\n````Shell\n$ conda install --file environment.yml\n```\n\nOnce all dependencies are satisfied, run:\n\n\n````Shell\n$ python setup.py install\n```\n\nNote that the installer script does _not_ check for dependencies. This will\ninstall the `smpdf` program and the `smpdflib` Python library in the appropiate\npaths.\n\n## Usage\n\nThe configuration is specified in YAML files (see `examples/`). A file consists\nof a list of observables (file paths to applgrids and specification of the\nperturbative order, where 0 is LO and 1 NLO), a list of PDF sets (valid LHAPDF\ngrids in the correct path) and a list of actions (see `--help` for a\ndescription).  \n\nSee\n\n````Shell\n$ smpdf --help\n```\n\nfor the full list of options. Note that you will probably want to\nrun with the `--use-db` flag.\n\nGenerating documentation\n------------------------\n\n[Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/) version 1.3.1 or greater is required. \n\nIn order to build the documentation, go into the `docs` directory, and\ntype:\n\n````bash\nmake api\nmake html\n````\n\nYou can use the other build targets allowed by Sphinx. Note that the\n`--help` flag provides an overview of the most useful options.\n",
