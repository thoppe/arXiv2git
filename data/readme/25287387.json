The latent residual variance estimates are then used as\npredictors in a regression of another outcome.\n\n[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/ElkhartGroup/varian.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/ElkhartGroup/varian)\n[![CRAN_Status_Badge](http://www.r-pkg.org/badges/version/varian)](http://cran.r-project.org/package=varian)\n\n# Getting Started\n\nAt its core, `varian` uses [`Stan`](http://mc-stan.org) to estimate the\nmodels.\n\n## Prerequisites\n\n### R\n\n`R` version 3.1.1 or later is required.  You can download the latest\nversion of `R` here:\n\n<http://www.r-project.org/>\n\n### Tools\n\n`Stan` and the `varian` package rely on being able to compile `C++`\ncode.\n\n* For Windows, download and install Rtools at\n  <http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/>\n* For Mac, make sure you have the latest version of Xcode installed.\n  The installation instructions for `rstan` provide more details.\n* For Linux, make sure you have a recent version of g++ or clang++.\n\n### RStan\n\nInstall the latest version of the\n[`rstan`](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started)\npackage (should happen automatically from CRAN now). That page also\nlists more detailed directions for getting the necessary tools\ninstalled.\n\n## Install varian\n\nYou can install:\n\n* the latest stable release from CRAN\n\n    ```R\n    install.packages(\"varian\", dependencies = TRUE)\n    ```\n\n* the latest development version from github\n\n\n    ```R\n    install.packages(\"devtools\")\n    devtools::install_github(\"ElkhartGroup/varian\")\n    ```\n\n## Learn about the theory\n\nSee our open access pre-print on the arXiv <http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.2961>.\n\n\n# More\n\n* If you find a bug or have a feature request, please let us know on\n  the issue tracker: <https://github.com/ElkhartGroup/varian/issues>.\n\n* Have questions or need support?  Email us at info@elkhartgroup.com\n  and mention \"varian\" in the subject.\n",
