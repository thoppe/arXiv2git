  "README.md": "LibBi package: OrnsteinUhlenbeckBridge\n======================================\n\nSynopsis\n--------\n\n    ./init.sh\n\nThis simulates a number of data sets for testing. GNU Octave is\nrequired. Running it is optional, as a number of simulated data sets are\nalready included.\n\n    ./run.sh\n    \nThis runs a particle filter as well as samples from the posterior\ndistribution for a data set of a single observation at time 1.\n\n    ./test.sh\n\nThis runs tests on the bootstrap and bridge particle filters on the simulated\ndata sets. Alternatively, these tests may be run as an array job on a cluster:\n\n    qsub -t 0-15 qsub_test_bridge.sh\n    qsub -t 0-15 qsub_test_bootstrap.sh\n\nFinally, results may be plot with:\n\n    octave --path oct/ --eval \"plot_and_print\"\n\nGNU Octave and OctBi are required.\n\nNote that, as of version 1.1.0 of LibBi, running any of these gives the\nwarnings:\n\n    Warning (line 29): 'obs' variables should not appear on the right side of actions in the 'transition' block.\n    Warning (line 42): 'obs' variables should not appear on the right side of actions in the 'lookahead_transition' block.\n\nThis is normal.\n\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nThis package includes an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck model that is observed\ndirectly. The task is to simulate diffusion bridges between the observed\nvalues. The form of the model is as studied in Ait-Sahalia (1999):\n\n$$dx=(\\theta_{1}-\\theta_{2}x)\\, dt+\\theta_{3}\\, dW,$$\n\nwith fixed parameters $\\theta_1 = 0.0187$, $\\theta_2 = 0.2610$ and $\\theta_3 =\n0.0224$.\n\nIt was used as a test case in Del Moral & Murray (2014). The package may be\nused to reproduce the results in that paper.\n\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nAit-Sahalia, Y.
