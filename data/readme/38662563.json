  "README.md": "# caffe-googlenet-bn\n\nThis model is a re-implementation of [Batch Normalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167) publication, and the model is trained with [a customized caffe-dev](https://github.com/lim0606/caffe-dev). \n\nThe network definition and solver prototxt files are modified from https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/tree/master/models/bvlc_googlenet \n\nNotes:\n- training with random crop;\n- training without any data-augmentation except random crop;\n- uses \"xavier\" to initialize the weights;\n- training with real-time shuffle with a modified [data_layer.cpp](https://github.com/lim0606/caffe-dev/blob/master/src/caffe/layers/data_layer.cpp);\n- batch normalization layer is modified version of https://github.com/ChenglongChen/batch_normalization. The modified bn layer supports batch normalization for inference. (See [neuron_layers.hpp](https://github.com/lim0606/caffe-dev/blob/master/include/caffe/neuron_layers.hpp), [bn_layer.cpp](https://github.com/lim0606/caffe-dev/blob/master/src/caffe/layers/bn_layer.cpp), and [bn_layer.cu](https://github.com/lim0606/caffe-dev/blob/master/src/caffe/layers/bn_layer.cu))\n- use [test_bn.cpp](https://github.com/lim0606/caffe-dev/blob/master/tools/test_bn.cpp) and [predict_bn.cpp](https://github.com/lim0606/caffe-dev/blob/master/tools/predict_bn.cpp) for inference. \n\nThe uploaded caffemodels are the snapshot of 1,200,000 iteration (30 epochs) using solver_stepsize_6400.prototxt\n\nThe uploaded model achieves a top-1 accuracy 71.69% (28.31% error) and a top-5 accuracy 90.67% (9.33% error) on the validation set, using a single random crop.\n\n\n# Refs\n[1] http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.4842\n\n[2] http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.03167\n\n\n## License\n\nThis model is released for unrestricted use.\n\n",
