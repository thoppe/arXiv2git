Compile C3D (compile also Python wrapper)\n2. Download the video dataset YUPENN (http://vision.eecs.yorku.ca/research/dynamic-scenes/) and extract the frames: the C3D wants the format %06d.jpg for the file image\n3. Edit the paths into C3D/examples/c3d_train_yupenn/lst_files/test_yupenn_full_4vid_shuffle.lst\n4. Run the script 'run_nengo_3d.py'   \n",
