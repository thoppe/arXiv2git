  "README.md": "# *Faster* R-CNN: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks\n\nBy Shaoqing Ren, Kaiming He, Ross Girshick, Jian Sun at Microsoft Research\n\n### Introduction\n\n**Faster** R-CNN is an object detection framework based on deep convolutional networks, which includes a Region Proposal Network (RPN) and an Object Detection Network. Both networks are trained for sharing convolutional layers for fast testing. \n\nFaster R-CNN was initially described in an [arXiv tech report](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.01497).\n\nThis repo contains a MATLAB re-implementation of Fast R-CNN. Details about Fast R-CNN are in: [rbgirshick/fast-rcnn](https://github.com/rbgirshick/fast-rcnn).\n\nThis code has been tested on Windows 7/8 64-bit, Windows Server 2012 R2, and Linux, and on MATLAB 2014a.\n\nPython version is available at [py-faster-rcnn](https://github.com/rbgirshick/py-faster-rcnn).\n\n### License\n\nFaster R-CNN is released under the MIT License (refer to the LICENSE file for details).\n\n### Citing Faster R-CNN\n\nIf you find Faster R-CNN useful in your research, please consider citing:\n\n    @article{ren15fasterrcnn,\n        Author = {Shaoqing Ren, Kaiming He, Ross Girshick, Jian Sun},\n        Title = {{Faster R-CNN}: Towards Real-Time Object Detection with Region Proposal Networks},\n        Journal = {arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.01497},\n        Year = {2015}\n    }\n\n### Main resutls\n                          | training data                          | test data            | mAP   | time/img\n------------------------- |:--------------------------------------:|:--------------------:|:-----:|:-----:\nFaster RCNN, VGG-16       | VOC 2007 trainval                      | VOC 2007 test        | 69.9% | 198ms\nFaster RCNN, VGG-16       | VOC 2007 trainval + 2012 trainval      | VOC 2007 test        | 73.2% | 198ms\nFaster RCNN, VGG-16       | VOC 2012 trainval                      | VOC 2012 test        | 67.0% | 198ms\nFaster RCNN, VGG-16       | VOC 2007 trainval&test + 2012 trainval | VOC 2012 test        | 70.4% | 198ms\n\n**Note**: The mAP results are subject to random variations. We have run 5 times independently for ZF net, and the mAPs are 59.9 (as in the paper), 60.4, 59.5, 60.1, and 59.5, with a mean of 59.88 and std 0.39.\n\n\n### Contents\n0.

Run `experiments/script_faster_rcnn_VOC2007_ZF.m` to train a model with ZF net. It runs four steps as follows:\n    - Train RPN with conv layers tuned; compute RPN results on the train/test sets.\n    - Train Fast R-CNN with conv layers tuned using step-1 RPN proposals; evaluate detection mAP.\n    - Train RPN with conv layers fixed; compute RPN results on the train/test sets. \n    - Train Fast R-CNN with conv layers fixed using step-3 RPN proposals; evaluate detection mAP.\n    - **Note**: the entire training time is ~12 hours on K40.\n0. Run `experiments/script_faster_rcnn_VOC2007_VGG16.m` to train a model with VGG net.\n    - **Note**: the entire training time is ~2 days on K40.\n0.
