Welcome\n--------------------\nPyNFG is designed to make it easy for researchers to model strategic environments using the Network Form Game (NFG) formalism developed by David Wolpert with contributions from Ritchie Lee, James Bono and others. The main idea of the NFG framework is to translate a strategic environment into the language of probabilistic graphical models. The result is a more intuitive, powerful, and user-friendly framework than the extensive form.\n\nFor an introduction to the semi-NFG framework and Level-K D-Relaxed Strategies:\n\n- Lee, R. and Wolpert, D.H., \"Game-Theoretic Modeling of Human Behavior in Mid-Air Collisions\",  Decision-Making with Imperfect Decision Makers, T.

Installation\n--------------------\nPyNFG requires the following packages: Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, Networkx, and PyGraphviz. Pygraphviz and Networkx are used only for visualizing the Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) that represent semi-NFGs.\n\nTo install from source: Download the source from https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyNFG/0.1.0.
