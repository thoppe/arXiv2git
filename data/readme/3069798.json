Moreover, it generates OOB error approximation and permutation-based attribute importance measure similar to [randomForest](http://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/RandomForests/cc_home.htm).\nHere is a [paper with all the details](http://www.jstatsoft.org/article/view/v061i10).\n\nrFerns is good for doing training fast and in predictable time; in general it is less accurate than Random Forest, yet not substantially, and obviously there are cases in which it is better.\nIt is also nice as a very fast variable importance source; in fact it was created to speed-up the [`Boruta` all relevant feature selector](https://m2.icm.edu.pl/boruta/), and [it did pretty well](http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2105/15/8/).\nFinally, it is a very stochastic method, practically doing no optimisation at all; basically it is crazy that it works.\nHence, it is theoretically interesting (;\n\nSince v0.3.2, it can do multi-label classification as well; here is [a conference paper about that](http://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-08326-1_22) ([arXiv version](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1403.7746)).\n\nThere is also a Spark version (not mine), [Sparkling Ferns](https://github.com/CeON/sparkling-ferns); also [this](https://spark-summit.org/eu-2015/events/sparkling-random-ferns-from-an-academic-paper-to-spark-packagesorg/).\n\nHow to use\n---------\n\nQuite fresh version should be on [CRAN](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rFerns/index.html); see the R docs for more.\n\nIf you want to compile R package, fire `updpak.sh` and then execute `R CMD INSTALL rFerns_x.y.z.tar.gz`.\nThis will build `roxygen2` documentation and fire `testthat2` tests (both of those packages, as well as `devtools`, should be installed; note that `devtools::install_github` will not work).\n\nIf you want to use it / test it apart from R, it is quite possible -- consult `side_src/test.c` to see how this may work.\nYet don't expect that this will ever become a standalone library.\n",
