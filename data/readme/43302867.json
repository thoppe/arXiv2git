  "README.md": "# ATHENA\nThe project is to create a Joint Model of Language and Perception for a Robotic Arm using Active Learning. We use an Amazon Echo and A Kinect Sensor in this project.\n\nINSTALLATION\n============\nPre-Requisities\n===============\nInstall ROS and a compatible version of gazebo. For the purpose of this project, the current version of ROS used is Indigo and Gazebo 2.2.6 has been installed.\n\nInstallation\n================\nCreate a catkin workspace by executing the following command:\n```\n$ cd src/\n$ catkin_init_workspace\n$ cd ..\n$ catkin_make\n```\nThis creates the workspace where the project can be executed.\n\nEXECUTION\n=========\nThe project is designed to work on both real sensors and in a simulated environment using Gazebo. To run it on Gazebo, execute the following commands. (Before executing, add the the current working directory to your environment by running the command in the main project folder ```$ source devel/setup.sh```\n\n```\n$ roslaunch jaco_kinect_gazebo kinect_world.launch\n```\nThis will start Gazebo with the kinect_world environment.\n\nNOTES\n=====\n## Integrate GAZEBO, ROS & HUSKY\n\n1.
