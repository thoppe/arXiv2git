  "README.md": "# SamuLife\n[Samu](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02889) (Nahshon) has learnt the rules of Conway's Game of Life. This is \nan example of the paper entitled \"Samu in his prenatal development\".\n\nThis project uses the same COP-based Q-learning engine as Samu ([Nahshon](https://github.com/nbatfai/nahshon)) to predict the next sentences of a conversation. \n\n## Experiments\n* #1: [https://youtu.be/p936TRxfC2I](https://youtu.be/p936TRxfC2I) It works very well, but its algorithm is unreasonable \n(the interpretation of the rewarding is unreasonable). \n* #2, v0.0.1-buggyQL: [https://youtu.be/WNrf9OhSbPQ](https://youtu.be/WNrf9OhSbPQ) \nThe behaviour and the algorithm of this is the same as the previous one.\n* #3, v0.0.2-manySamus-withoutNN-toYouTube: (so many little Samus, without neural network architecture, it uses a simple lookup table) \n[https://youtu.be/BnNVM8XNDSA](https://youtu.be/BnNVM8XNDSA) \nThis algorithm has already been reasonable and it has worked very well.\n* #4, v0.0.3-manySamus-withNN-toYouTube: [https://youtu.be/b60m__3I-UM](https://youtu.be/b60m__3I-UM) \nIf this algorithm is the same as the previous (reasonable but now with neural networks to approximate the Q values) then it has \nnot yet worked very well. But with a modified perception, this algorithm has also been reasonable and it has worked very well too.\n* #5, v0.0.4-predicting-the-present-eliminated: It is important to note that in the previous version the COP-based Q-learning \nhas become trivial because after a short starting period it chooses the Q-action \nthat was passed in as the actual cell state argument. It means that the agent \ndoes not predict the future but the present. This version has already been \nimproved. It really predicts the future that can be seen well in the video at \nhttps://youtu.be/j6bus5efESU\n* #6, v0.0.5-buggy+rewardtable:\n\n## Usage\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/nbatfai/SamuLife.git\ncd SamuLife/\n~/Qt/5.5/gcc_64/bin/qmake SamuLife.pro\nmake\n./SamuLife\n```\n\n## Experiments with this project\n\n\n### v0.0.1-buggyQL\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/nbatfai/SamuLife.git\ncd SamuLife/\ngit checkout v0.0.1-buggyQL\n~/Qt/5.5/gcc_64/bin/qmake SamuLife.pro\nmake\n./SamuLife\n```\n[https://youtu.be/WNrf9OhSbPQ](https://youtu.be/WNrf9OhSbPQ)\n\n![samulife](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3148120/12007817/7252e9c0-ac16-11e5-9b7a-faa747d93929.png)\n\n### v0.0.2-manySamus-withoutNN-toYouTube\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/nbatfai/SamuLife.git\ncd SamuLife/\ngit checkout v0.0.2-manySamus-withoutNN-toYouTube\n~/Qt/5.5/gcc_64/bin/qmake SamuLife.pro\nmake\n./SamuLife\n```\n[https://youtu.be/BnNVM8XNDSA](https://youtu.be/BnNVM8XNDSA)\n\n![slexp3](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3148120/12130724/2d36e82e-b40d-11e5-9412-acb9bff4e932.png)\n\n### v0.0.3-manySamus-withNN-toYouTube\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/nbatfai/SamuLife.git\ncd SamuLife/\ngit checkout v0.0.3-manySamus-withNN-toYouTube\n~/Qt/5.5/gcc_64/bin/qmake SamuLife.pro\nmake\n./SamuLife\n```\n[https://youtu.be/b60m__3I-UM](https://youtu.be/b60m__3I-UM)\n\n![slexp4](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3148120/12130890/88a380e0-b40e-11e5-9459-7d204669baa0.png)\n\n\n### v0.0.4-predicting-the-present-eliminated\n\nIt is important to note that in the previous version the COP-based Q-learning \nhas become trivial because after a short starting period it chooses the Q-action \nthat was passed in as the actual cell state argument.
