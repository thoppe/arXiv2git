  "README.md": "# Honeycombs\nCode for visualizing spherical, euclidean, and hyperbolic honeycombs in various ways:\n  * STL models for Shapeways\n  * POV-Ray definition files for rendering\n  * Upper half space boundary images for hyperideal honeycombs\n\nThis code is a companion to the paper \"Visualizing Hyperbolic Honeycombs\" by Roice Nelson and Henry Segerman (http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02851).  The code itself was authored by Roice.  Images generated by this software are available for bulk download at www.hyperbolichoneycombs.org.\n\nI consider some areas an overgrown garden in need of refactoring/reorganization, but I still wanted to publish it along with our paper for any who might like to try to recreate calculations we've done.  There is no UI, and I made use of commenting in the main Program.cs file (and in some other files) to control particular outputs I was going for.  Furthermore, the shared R3.Core library contains code not related to honeycombs - that library was mainly developed as part of the MagicTile project.  Unfortunately, R3.Core has a dependency on the OpenTK library, so installing that will be required to build (at the moment).\n",
