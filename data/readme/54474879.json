  "README.md": "# LikeDM_v1.0\n\nLikeDM is a likelihood calculator of dark matter detection. \n\nThe basic function of LikeDM is \nto deal with the intermediate steps between the input dark matter model and the\ndata. It enables fast computation of the likelihood of a given dark matter model (mass, cross section\nor decay rate, annihilation or decay yield spectrum), without digging into\nthe details of cosmic-ray propagation, Fermi-LAT data analysis, and related \nastrophysical backgrounds.\n\n##LikeDM material\n\n- [Latest version](https://github.com/LikeDM/LikeDM_v1.0)\n\n>You might want to download it from \n\n>[LikeDM@hepforge](https://likedm.hepforge.org/)\n\n- [Manual](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07119)\n\n>LikeDM: likelihood calculator of dark matter detection   \nXiaoyuan Huang, Yue-Lin Sming Tsai, Qiang Yuan   \n[arXiv:1603.07119](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07119)\n\nThe currently released version (v1.0) contains only the indirect ditection \npart, including\n\n- the electron/positron measurements by AMS-02,\n- the antiproton measurements by PAMELA, and \n- the gamma-ray observations from dwarf spheroidal satellite galaxies by Fermi-LAT.\n \n\nFurther developments with more data, e.g., from the gamma-ray observations of the Galactic center and isotropic background, as well as the underground direct detection data, will be carried out soon.\n\nAuthors:\n\nXiaoyuan Huang ([huangxiaoyuan@gmail.com](huangxiaoyuan@gmail.com))   \nYue-Lin Sming Tsai ([smingtsai@gmail.com](smingtsai@gmail.com))   \nQiang Yuan ([yuanq@pmo.ac.cn](yuanq@pmo.ac.c))\n",
