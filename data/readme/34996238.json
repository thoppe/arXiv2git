  "README.md": "# What is this repository for?\nThis repository contains python implementation of rational Krylov methods (ALR, KPIK, RKSM) for obtaining approximation of solution of continuous-time Lyapunov equation. The main computational costs for all methods are linear system solutions, so algebraic multigrid techniques can be applyed for methods acceleration instead of scipy direct solver. \n\nKPIK method is described in the paper [V. Simoncini, A new iterative method for solving large-scale Lyapunov matrix equations](http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/06066120X)\n\nRKSM method is described in the paper [V. Druskin, C. Lieberman, M. Zaslavsky, adaptive choice of shifts in rational Krylov subspace reduction of evolutionary problems](http://dx.doi.org/10.1137/090774082)\n\nThe Python code for KPIK and RKMS is based on the publicly available MATLAB implementation http://www.dm.unibo.it/~simoncin/software.html\n\n# Citing \nALR method is described in paper \n\n    @article{kolesnikov2014low,\n      title={From low-rank approximation to an efficient rational Krylov subspace method for the Lyapunov equation},\n      author={Kolesnikov, D. A. and Oseledets, I. V.},\n      journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1410.3335},\n      year={2014}\n    }\n\n# Documentation\nwill be available soon.\n\n# Requirements\nYou need only numpy and scipy to run example, since there are pure python functions.\nFor algebraic multigrid usage [PyAMG library](https://github.com/pyamg/pyamg/) is required.\n\n# Python version support\nCurrent implementation was succesfully tested with numpy 1.9.2, scipy 0.15.1 and ipython-notebook 3.1.0 for Python 2.7.9\n\nMain Contributor\nDenis Kolesnikov d4kolesnikov@yandex.ru\n",
