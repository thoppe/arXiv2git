For further details the documentation should be helpful.\n\nThe preprint Computational Holonomy Decomposition of Transformation Semigroups http://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06345 contains a constructive proof of the holonomy decomposition that is in close correspondence to the implementation.\n\n## Where to complain when something goes wrong?\n\nPlease report any problem or request features by creating on issue on the project page here.\n\n## Who are you?\n\nAttila Egri-Nagy www.egri-nagy.hu @EgriNagy\n\nJames D.
