  "README.md": "# K-Means-Clustering-for-prediction-of-Student-Academic-Performance\n\nAuthor: Roy Eyono\n\nInspired by Oyelade,Oladipupo and Obagbuwa's paper on the application of the k-Means Clustering algorithm for the prediction of Students' Academic Performance, I decided to create a practical application of their paper on Java.\n\nI approached the problem from a Software Engineering point of view and reused code previously written by unidentified coding enthusiasts(link below). These enthusiasts had written the implementation of the K-Means Clustering Algorithm, regardless of a few bugs in the code, it worked like a charm. I had to, however tailor it to solve the problem at hand. Due to the lack of data, I had to generate random data.\n\nBasically, I setup a theoretical classroom with 100 students, with the marks coming in the form of percentiles. Each students takes a total of 5 subjects/modules, it is now up to the algorithm to group these students into five groups and rating them using this metric:\n\n--------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------\n70 and above                Excellent\n60-69                       Very Good\n50-59                       Good\n45-49                       Very Fair\n40-45                       Fair\nBelow 45                    Poor \n\n--------------------------------------\n--------------------------------------\n\nThe numbers represent the overall performance of each cluster, the formula to calculating the overall performance of a cluster can be found on the paper.\n\nLink to the implementation of the K-Means Algorithm: http://www.dataonfocus.com/k-means-clustering-java-code/\nLink to Oyelade,Oladipupo and Obagbuwa's paper: http://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/1002/1002.2425.pdf\n\nFeel free to email me, if there are any errors or suggestions, it would be greatly appreciated to get some feedback!\nEmail: royeyono@yahoo.com\n",
