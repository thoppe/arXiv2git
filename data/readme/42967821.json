Oberweger, P. Wohlhart, and V. Lepetit. Hands Deep in\nDeep Learning for Hand Pose Estimation. CVWW, 2015.\n\nI've added 3 new layers to caffe, in the src/caffe/layers directory\n- HandData which loads a variety of hand image/annotation formats\n- PCA which implements Oberweger's PCA bottleneck initialization\n- MVRegLoss which adds visualization to the euclidean loss\n\n# step-by-step instructions\n\n- Download the NYU HANDS dataset (http://horatio.cs.nyu.edu/mit/tompson/nyu_hand_dataset_v2.zip) into /mnt/data/NYU-Hands-v2/\n- Download the deep_hand_pose code\n\n> git clone git@github.com:jsupancic/deep_hand_pose.git ~/deep_hand_pose\n\n- I've converted the annotations from .mat to .csv for you:\n\n> cd ~/deep_hand_pose/\n\n> cp nyu_csv_annotations/test/*.csv /mnt/data/NYU-Hands-v2/test/ \n\n> cp nyu_csv_annotations/test/*.csv /mnt/data/NYU-Hands-v2/train/\n\n- Compile caffe and deep_hand_pose\n\n> cd ~/deep_hand_pose/ &&\n> mkdir build &&\n> pushd build &&\n> cmake ..  &&\n> make -j16 &&\n> popd \n\n- create the directory where results will be stored\n\n> mkdir out\n\n- now run the pre-trained model on the NYU dataset! \n\n> examples/deep_hand_pose/train.sh\n    \n# Deep Hand Base License and Citation\n\nThe license is the same as caffe from which this is derived.
