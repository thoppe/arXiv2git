  "README.md": "## DeepPed: *Deep Convolutional Neural Networks for Pedestrian Detection*\n\nCreated by Denis Tome, Federico Monti, Luca Baroffio and Luca Bondi.\n\n### Introduction\n\nDeepPed is a state-of-the-art pedestrian detector that extends R-CNN work done by Girshick et al. combining region proposals with rich features computed by a convolutional neural network. This method achieves 19.90% log-average-miss-rate on the Caltech Pedestrian Dataset.\n\nDeepPed is described in an [arXiv tech report](http://arxiv.org/abs/1510.03608) and will appear in Elsevier Journal of Signal Processing.\n\n### Citing R-CNN\n\nIf you find R-CNN useful in your research, please consider citing:\n\n    @article{tome2015Deep,\n        author = {Tome, Denis and Monti, Federico and Baroffio, Luca and Bondi, Luca and Tagliasacchi, Marco and Tubaro, Stefano},\n        title = {Deep convolutional neural networks for pedestrian detection},\n        journal = {arXiv preprint arXiv:1510.03608},\n        year = {2015}\n    }\n}\n\n### License\n\nDeepPed is released under the Simplified BSD License (refer to the\nLICENSE file for details).\n\n### Installing R-CNN\n\n0. **Prerequisites** \n  0. MATLAB (tested with 2015a on 64-bit Linux)\n  0. Caffe's [prerequisites](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html#prequequisites)\n0. **Install Caffe and R-CNN**\n  0. Download [Caffe](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe)\n  0. Download R-CNN and follow the [instructions](http://github.com/rbgirshick/rcnn)\n0. **Install DeepPed**\n  0. Change into the R-CNN source code directory: `cd rcnn`\n  0. Get the DeepPed source code by cloning the repository: `git clone https://github.com/DenisTome/DeepPed.git`\n  0. Get the Piotr's Image & Video Matlab Toolbox by cloning the repository: `git clone https://github.com/pdollar/toolbox.git`\n  0. From the `R-CNN` folder, run the model fetch script: `./DeepPed/fetch_models.sh`. \n  0. Open the `startup.m` matlab file, adding the two commands `addpath(genpath('DeepPed'));` and `addpath(genpath('toolbox'));` at the end of the file.\n\n### Running DeepPed on an image\n\n1. Change to where you installed R-CNN: `cd rcnn`. \n2. Start MATLAB `matlab`.\n  * **Important:** if you don't see the message `R-CNN startup done` when MATLAB starts, then you probably didn't start MATLAB in `rcnn` directory.\n3. Run the demo: `>> deepPed_demo`\n",
