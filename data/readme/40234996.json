You need to decide what do yu want to study. bit.ly/1lQsqpu\n- EPSRC UK main founding program, another one is EMCS\n- \n## Aims:\n\n- optimize materials, design, understandig for solar application\n- metastable: understand phase transition and instability\n- MOF: electronactive and magnetic and ferroelectric materials\n- Aron one month a month in Yonsei. Dual professor.\niTren now needs to record holidays for PostD, and bookLab for PhD.\n\n## Meetings:\n\n- Monday: updates on research in the group.\n- Tuesday: JC\n- Tue/Thu: subgroup meetings.\n- Cox.

Theory of Solids\n- \n## Software\n\n- Evernote\n- Todoist\n- Oldreader\n- Jupyter\n- \n## DATA ACCESS STATEMENT\n\n- Different fields have their own option to share information and data online\n- GitHub: a repo with all the data used to produce a paper. Than you can create a doi with a snapshot.\n\n## Personal Account\n\n- Google scholar\n- Researcher ID\n- Research Gate\n\n## Open Access\n\n- Green Open Access: preprint. arXiv. Free copy before typeset, or institutional repository.\n- Gold paid model. Open under CC. On Nat Com. it is three thousand pounds. The money comes from the UK research council.\nThe logic is first come first served. Typically from consumable.\n## PC:\n- Neon: two free nodes. \n- Balena two eight eight four cpus. + GPU + Phi\n- Prace: at least 6 months.\nCheck for the acknowledgements.\n\n## LIBRAY plenty of eBooks.\n- Careers advisors for postDoc and PhD. \n\n-Apply for scholarship and vursaries.\n\n## SOFTWARE:\n- PBC = Vasp, FHI-AIMS, QE, GPAW-open\n- mol = GAMESS FHI-AIMS, TURBOMOL, NWCHEM-open\n- postprocess = YAMBO-open, ASE-open, ChemSHELL, Metadise\n\n## Understand Experiments\n- need understanding to interpretate things.\n\n##  Toolkit\n- Workhorse DFT\n- scripting Pythn\n- MD, MQ,...\n\n## CONVERGENCE\n- prove, not state.\n\n## Publications\n\n## Ethic of Authorship\nCorrespondant: person responsabile for founding, integrity and legal issues.\n\n## Clear and Coincide- Scientific english\n- after this always specify the noun\n- colons and semicolons.\n\n## Software\n- Crystalmaker\n- VESTA\n- Blender, VMD.\n\n## Comment\n- Structure: resumee, interesting or not, ...\n- Major: extra point\n- Minor: language\n\n# JONATHAN: Python + MatplotLib\n\n# Chris \n\n- Bad figures are objective\n- Figure first\n- Use Projection, classic one: trenta, quarantacinque,...\n\n## Jarvist\n- Maslow http://web.cortland.edu/andersmd/MASLOW/HOMEPAGE.HTML\n- UNIX: hierarchical file system\n- old style folder, new style should be version control aka github\n- pushd and popd\n- NEVER USED cd ..\n- ls comands\n- sudo su user you become user without password\n- grep -C number of lines, -A after, -B before\n- find ./ -iname name\n- find ./ -mtime number\n- #! pipe this file to interpreter, even fortran\n- #!/bin/bash -x u can pass comands\n- -xv fast to debug\n\n# quote\n- ` used an option, not a variable. it excute the comand. and the result is used.\n- for COMAND_LINE_ARGUMENT\n- substitute. SHELL SUBSTITUTION\n- sed could use other caracthers instead of slash so s/ is equivalent to s#\n- awk\n- tmux, keeps terminal opens. useful\n \n# Keith\n\n## Macrodensity \n\n- read cube files or 3d files.\n- Macrodensity, VASP does not print core levels properly with damped MD algorithm.\n- \n\n",
