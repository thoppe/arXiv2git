  "README": "TODO: Official radiative seesaw in Seesaw branch, seesaw directory. Clean unnecessary dirs there. \n!   We use 'gmake' options in our Makefiles. If you do not have 'gmake' \n!   then more likely your  'make'  is identical to 'gmake'.\n\n\nI. General  installation.\n   Launch\n       [g]make \n\n   It should generate files with compilers flags\n       CalcHEP_src/FlagsForMake\n       CalcHEP_src/FlagsForSh\n   \n   and  compile  \n       CalcHEP_src/bin/s_calchep \n       sources/micromegas.a\n\n   Possible problems are discussed in Section VII below. \n\n   micromegas_2.4 was tested for  Linux, OSF1, SunOS, Darwin, \n   Cygwin.\n \nII. To work with MSSM, NMSSM, CPVMSSM, LHM, RHNM  models\n    go to the corresponding directory. \n\n    To generate an executable use\n     [g]make main=<source file>\n                                                          \n    <source file> is expected to be a C  (.c) file, C++ (.cpp) one,\n     or a Fortran (.F) file.\n\n    The list of functions you can use in  your programs is described in \n    hep-ph/0405253, hep-ph/0607059, arXiv:0803.2360[hep-ph] and arXiv:1005.4133[hep-ph].\n\n *** For Cygwin, launch an executable with \n    ../cgwRun <exe with parameters>\n\nIII. Each model directory  contains at least 2 sample  files: \n      main.c \n      main.F\n      a sample for C++  can be obtained by 'cp main.c main.cpp'\n \n     main.c and main.F  contain  several independent modules \n     which can be switched ON  by '#define' preprocessor instructions\n     at the top of the file.\n\n     The modules are:\n\n   a) MASSES_INFO\n       displays mass spectrum for odd particles (super partners) and \n       Higgs particles;\n   b) CONSTRAINTS\n       checks experimental  constraints;  \n   c) OMEGA\n       computes the relic density;\n   d) INDIRECT_DETECTION\n       calculates  WIMP annihilation spectra and integrate\n       over halo profile;\n   e) RESET_FORMFACTORS\n       resets parameters of nucleon form factors, DM velocity \n       distribution, and nucleus Fermi density;\n   f) WIMP_NUCLEON\n       calculates WIMP-nucleon elastic scattering amplitudes\n   g) WIMP_NUCLEUS\n       calculates the number of events for 1day&1kg  of detector material and \n       recoil energy distribution for WINP-nuclei reaction;\n   h) CROSS_SECTIONS\n       calculates different  widths and cross sections\n\nIV. Each model directory contains a subdirectory  'calchep/' intended \n    for calculation of different cross sections and decay widths \n    in  interactive sessions  for SM and other models.  \n        \nV.To implement a new model, launch \n    ./newProject  <project name>\n      \n Then the directory <project name> will be created with all needed subdirectories \n and  sample  files inside. Further instructions can be found in the local \n README file. \n      \nVI. To clean all generated files use \n   [g]make clean \n      or  \n   ./clean \n   launched from micromegas_2.4 directory. In each model directory you \n   can call \n     [g]make clean \n   to remove all generated files in this particular directory.\n\nVII. Compilers and  their Flags\n    Options for compilation are stored in the file \n       CalcHEP/FlagsForSh   \n    If this files does not exist, it is generated by [g]make according \n    to Unix version. If CalcHEP/FlagsForSh exists, [g]make\n    only checks it.  In case of problem with compilers and their flags \n    one can improve CalcHEP/FlagsForSh and launch [g]make again.\n    Using \n         [g]make clean \n    you will be asked about an option to save FlagsForSh for the next\n    compilation.  \n        [g]make flags\n    only generates FlagsForSh file. It gives you an option to \n    select the compiler and flags you prefer. \n\nVIII.
