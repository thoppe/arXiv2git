  "README.md": "70 lines of NumPy\n=================\n\nThis code solves the MuMag standard problem #4 in less than 70 lines of pure\nPython without counting empty lines and comments :). The code makes largely\nuse of the NumPy library and computes the exchange field by finite differences\nand the demagnetization field with a fast convolution algorithm. Since the\nmagnetization in finite-difference micromagnetics is represented by a\nmulti-dimensional array and the NumPy library features a rich interface for\nthis data structure, the presented code is a good starting point for the\ndevelopment of novel algorithms.\n\nA detailed description of the code can be found here: http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.7188\n",
