Eigen/singular vectors are\ncomputed entrywise to almost full accuracy, so they are automatically mutually\northogonal.  The algorithms are based on a shift-and-invert approach.  Only a\nsingle element of the inverse of the shifted matrix eventually needs to\nbe computed with double the working precision.\n\nThe package also contains routines for applications:\n* divide-and-conquer routine for symmetric tridiagonal eigenvalue problem\n* roots of real polynomials with real distinct roots.\n\n\n### Contents\n\n#### Arrowhead and DPR1 Eigenvalues\nThe file `arrowhead1.jl` contains definitions of types\n`SymArrow` (arrowhead) and `SymDPR1`. Full matrices are accessible\nwith `full(A)`.\n\nThe file `arrowhead3.jl` contains routines to generate random symmetric\narrowhead and DPR1 matrices, ` GenSymArrow` and `GenSymDPR1`, respectively,\nthree functions `inv()` which compute various inverses of _SymArrow_\nmatrices, two functions `bisect()` which compute outer eigenvalues of\n_SymArrow_ and _SymDPR1_ matrices, the main computational function `eig()` which\ncomputes the k-th eigenpair of an ordered unreduced  _SymArrow_,\nand the driver function `eig()` which computes all eigenvalues and\neigenvectors of a _SymArrow_.\n\nThe file `arrowhead4.jl` contains three functions `inv()` which compute\nvarious inverses of _SymDPR1_ matrices, the main computational function `eig()`\nwhich computes the k-th eigenpair of an ordered unreduced _SymDPR1_,\nand the driver function `eig()` which computes all eigenvalues and\neigenvectors of a _SymDPR1_.\n\n#### Half-arrowhead SVD\n\nThe file `arrowhead5.jl` contains definition of type `HalfArrow`.\n_HalfArrow_ is of the form _[diagm(A.D) A.z]_ where either\n_length(A.z)=length(A.D)_\nor _length(A.z)=length(A.D)+1_, thus giving two possible\nforms of the SVD rank one update.  The file `arrowhead6.jl` contains\nthe function `doubledot()`, three functions `inv()` which compute\nvarious inverses of _HalfArrow_ matrices, the main computational function `svd()`\nwhich computes the k-th singular value triplet _u, sigma, v_ of an ordered\nunreduced _HalfArrow_,  and the driver function `svd()` which computes all\nsingular values and vectors of a _HalfArrow_.\n\n#### Tridiagonal Divide and Conquer\n\nThe file `arrowhead7.jl` contains a simple function `tdc()` which implements\ndivide-and-conquer method for `SymTridiagonal` matrices by spliting the matrix\nin two parts  and connecting the parts via eigenvalue decomposition of\narrowhead matrix.\n\n#### Polynomial Roots\n\nThe file `arrowhead7.jl` conatains the function `rootsah()` which computes the\nroots of `Int32`, `Int64`, `Float32` and `Float64` polynomials with all distinct real roots. The computation is\nforward stable. The program uses `SymArrow` form of companion matrix in\nbarycentric coordinates and\nthe corresponding `eig()` function specially designed for this case.\nThe file also contains three functions `inv()`. Similarly, the file\n`arrowhead8.jl` conatains the function `rootsah()` which computes the\nroots of `BigInt` and `BigFloat` polynomials with all distinct real roots.\nThe file also contains function `rootsWDK()`, an implementation of the\nWeierstrass-Durand-Kerner polynomial root finding algorithm.\n\n\n### Authors and References\n\nThe functions for arrowhead and half-arrowhead matrices\nwere developed and analysed by [Jakovcevic Stor, Barlow and\nSlapnicar (2013)][JSB2013]\n(see also [arXiv:1302.7203][JSB2013a]).\nThe routines for DPR1 matrices are described and analysed in [Jakovcevic\nStor, Barlow and Slapnicar (2015)][JSB2015] (the paper is [freely downloadable](http://authors.elsevier.com/a/1Rmlt5YnCLEdU) until\nNov 15, 2015, see also [arXiv:1405.7537][JSB2015a]). The polynomial root finder is described and analyzed\nin [Jakovcevic Stor and Slapnicar (2015)][JS2015].\n\nThe Matlab version of the\nroutines used in the papers are written Ivan Slapnicar and Nevena Jakovcevic\nStor. The first version of Julia routines was written by Ivan Slapnicar during a visit\nto MIT, and later version were written by Ivan Slapnicar and Nevena Jakovcevic Stor.\n\n\nDouble the working precision is implemented by using routines by\n[T. J. Dekker (1971)][dekker1971] from the package [DoubleDouble][byrne2014]\nby Simon Byrne.\n\n### Thanks\n\nHighly appreciated help and advice came from [Jiahao Chen][jiahao],\n[Andreas Noack][andreasnoack], [Jake Bolewski][jakebolewski] and\n[Simon Byrne][simonbyrne].\n\n\n[JSB2013]: http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024379513006265 \"Nevena Jakovcevic Stor, Ivan Slapnicar and Jesse L.
