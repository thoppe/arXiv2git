I use this tool together with Git for version control\nand [JabRef](http://jabref.sourceforge.net/) for browsing. This tool adheres more to the Unix philosophy that a small tool\nfor each task is better than one thing which tries to solve everything. If you use [JabRef](http://jabref.sourceforge.net/)\nfor browsing and tagging it is unnecessary to sort the papers into different sub directories by hand.\nJust throw them all in one directory!\n\n__Note__: This tool is derived from a script which I used during my thesis. It worked\nquite well and reliable during that time. But be aware that I used Git for version control\nof the [BibTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX) file. So any mistakes which might be made by this tool could be reverted.\n\nFeatures\n--------\n\nBibSync supports the following features:\n\n* Synchronization between a [BibTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX) file and a directory containing the papers in pdf, ps or djvu format\n* [JabRef](http://jabref.sourceforge.net/) file fields are generated, so you can open the existing papers directly out of [JabRef](http://jabref.sourceforge.net/)\n* Downloading of [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/) or [DOI](http://dx.doi.org/) metadata\n* Extraction of [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/) or [DOI](http://dx.doi.org/) id out of the file using [pdftotext](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pdftotext)\n* Downloading of new versions of [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/) papers\n* Simple validation of [BibTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX) files (Checks for missing fields etc)\n* Simple transformation of [BibTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX) fields (Normalization of author, year and journal field...)\n* Works under every platform supporting Ruby and `pdftotext` (Linux, Windows, ...)\n\nQuick start\n-----------\n\nAt first you have to ensure that you have the `pdftotext` program available on your `$PATH`. Under Debian you can install\nthe package using `apt-get` as follows\n\n~~~\n$ apt-get install poppler-utils\n$ pdftotext\npdftotext version 0.24.1\n...\n~~~\n\nBibSync requires Ruby >= 1.9.2 to run. It is distributed as a RubyGems package. You can install it via\nthe command line\n\n~~~\n$ gem install bibsync\n~~~\n\nAnd for updating, you write\n\n~~~\n$ gem update bibsync\n~~~\n\nAfter that you can use the 'bibsync' tool on the command line. At first let's validate\na [BibTeX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BibTeX) file called 'thesis.bib'.\n\n~~~\n$ bibsync -b ~/thesis/thesis.bib\n~~~\n\nThen we want to synchronize all the papers in our paper directory with 'bibsync' and automatically download\nthe missing metadata.\n\n~~~\n$ bibsync -d ~/thesis/papers -b ~/thesis/thesis.bib\n~~~\n\nBibSync tries to download the metadata from [arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org) and [dx.doi.org](http://dx.doi.org). If you want to know more about the functions of 'bibsync' take a look at the command line help.\n\n~~~\n$ bibsync --help\n~~~\n\nMy setup\n--------\n\n* BibSync for synchronizing\n* [JabRef](http://jabref.sourceforge.net/) for browsing the bibliography, tagging and categorizing papers\n* [Biblatex](http://www.ctan.org/pkg/biblatex) to include a bibliography in LaTeX with full Unicode support\n\nAlternatives\n------------\n\n* [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/) (Commercial, synchronizes with their server, limited disk space, bloated gui application)\n* [Zotero](http://www.zotero.org/) (Firefox plugin, Open source)\n\nA better name?\n--------------\n\nIf you have a suggestion for a better name, just let me know...\n\nAuthor\n------\n\nDaniel Mendler\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nSee LICENSE\n",
