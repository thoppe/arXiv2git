Dolphin, Benjamin D.\nJohnson, Alexia R. Lewis, Evan D. Skillman, Daniel R. Weisz, Benjamin F.\nWilliams\n\nStar formation histories derived from resolved optical photometry from PHAT\nwere used to create maps of broadband flux in the ultraviolet. The maps cover\nroughly one third of the disk of M31 and have a resolution of ~440x100 pc. The\nmaps were compared with observations from GALEX.\n\nThis repository contains the following:\n\n- `m31flux`: the data processing and analysis python package for the M31\n  flux maps project. These packages are required:\n\n  - `astrogrid <http://github.com/jesaerys/astrogrid>`_\n  - `astropy <http://www.astropy.org>`_\n  - `match-wrapper <http://github.com/jesaerys/match-wrapper>`_\n  - `numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_\n\n- scripts: python scripts, including main, which serves as the frontend\n  to `m31flux` and is the complete research and analysis record.\n\n- maps: modeled and observed flux maps in FITS format produced by\n  scripts/main.\n\n- docs:\n\n  - sphinx documentation (Coming soon!)\n  - paper draft; intended for submission to arXiv, and eventually ApJ.\n",
