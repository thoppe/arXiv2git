  "README.md": "admm-speed-test\n===============\n\nCode for comparing ADMM and an interior-point method, as presented in\n[Hinge-Loss Markov Random Fields and Probabilistic Soft Logic](http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.04406)\nand my Ph.D. dissertation. It also contains the data and setup for the paper\n[Scaling MPE Inference for Constrained Continuous Markov Random Fields with Consensus Optimization](http://stephenbach.net/files/bach-nips12.pdf),\nbut this code tests the improved version of the inference algorithm for\npiecewise-quadratic problem.\n\nPlease cite this work as\n\n\t@article{bach:arxiv15,\n\t Title = {Hinge-Loss Markov Random Fields and Probabilistic Soft Logic},\n\t Author = {Bach, Stephen H. and Broecheler, Matthias and Huang, Bert and Getoor, Lise},\n\t Volume = {arXiv:1505.04406 [cs.LG]},\n\t Year = {2015}}\n\nInstructions\n=============\n\nPrerequisites\n-------------\nThis software depends on Java 6+ and [Maven 3](http://maven.apache.org).\nPython (>=2.7) is also required to process the results.\n\nRunning the experiment also requires installing the [MOSEK](http://mosek.com)\nadd-on for PSL. Please follow the [instructions](https://github.com/linqs/psl/wiki/MOSEK-add-on).\n\nPSL Library\n-----------\nThe algorithms for this experiment is implemented in the PSL library,\n[version 1.2](https://github.com/linqs/psl/tree/1.2). It will be downloaded\nby Maven automatically.\n\nExecuting\n---------\nThe experiment can be run by executing run.sh.\n",
