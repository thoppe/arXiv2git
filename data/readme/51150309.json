If not, install it via brew:\n\n```bash\nbrew install gcc\n```\n\n#### NodeJS\n\nJust install the last stable version from https://nodejs.org, or use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)\n\n#### Logml\n\nTo install Logml, just run the following command :\n\n```bash\nnpm install -g logml\n```\n\nNow you can use the `logml` command:\n\n```bash\nlogml --help\n```\n\n\n\n## Usage\n\nThe Logml modelling and simulation tool takes a logical graph (.graphml format) as input. The tool will automatically parse the graph and generate the corresponding code. The logical model is then executed and results are plotted via a dedicated web interface.\n\n### Logical graph\n\nA logical graph is a special type of diagramatic structure in which entities are linked by logical relations symbolized by the logic operators: `AND`, `OR` and `NOT`.\n\nWe use for that the [yED graph editor](https://www.yworks.com/downloads#yEd) (which is freely available and runs on all major platforms), and the [following graphical ontology](test/fixtures/graphml/graphical_ontology.graphml):\n\n![](http://nodys.github.io/logml/images/Graphical_ontology.png)\n\nPlease find bellow an example of a logical graph, which will be used throughout this tutorial:\n\n![](http://nodys.github.io/logml/images/example.png)\n\nIn order to ensure the proper functioning of Logml tool, the following instructions must be observed carefully during the creation of the logical graph in [yED](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed).\n\n#### Annotation of nodes\n\nEach node of the graph (entity) need to be annotated (in yED, right click on the node > `properties` > `data`) with its qualitative initial values (integers only, and between 0 and 5). The node initial states are defined as following:\n\n| Annotation | Meaning   |\n|:-----------|:----------|\n| `v0=5`     | full      |\n| `v0=4`     | much more |\n| `v0=3`     | much      |\n| `v0=2`     | few       |\n| `v0=1`     | fewer     |\n| `v0=0`     | none      |\n\nPlease find below an example of node annotation:\n\n![](http://nodys.github.io/logml/images/node-annotation.png)\n\n#### Annotation of edges\n\nEach edge need to be annotated (in yED, right click on the edge > `properties` > `general`) with its qualitative `p` and `q` values (integers only, and between 0 and 5).\n\n+ For each edges, `p` is the portion of its value which is updated at each iteration:\n\n| Annotation | Meaning       |\n|:-----------|:--------------|\n| `p=5`      | instantaneous |\n| `p=4`      | faster        |\n| `p=3`      | fast          |\n| `p=2`      | slow          |\n| `p=1`      | slower        |\n| `p=0`      | down          |\n\n+ For each edges, `q` is the weakening of its value at each iteration:\n\n| Annotation | Meaning |\n|:-----------|:--------|\n| `q=5`      | strong  |\n| `q=4`      | weaker  |\n| `q=3`      | weak    |\n| `q=2`      | faint   |\n| `q=1`      | fainter |\n| `q=0`      | down    |\n\nPlease find below an example of edge annotation:\n\n![](http://nodys.github.io/logml/images/edge-annotation.png)\n\n#### Annotation of perturbed nodes\n\nWe can identify nodes that will be the subject of a disturbance by annotating (in yED, right click on the entity > `properties` > `data`) with:\n\n+ the strength of the disturbance applied to the node. The disturbed states will be defined as following (integers only, and between 0 and 5):\n\n| Annotation | Meaning   |\n|:-----------|:----------|\n| `pwd=5`    | full      |\n| `pwd=4`    | much more |\n| `pwd=3`    | much      |\n| `pwd=2`    | few       |\n| `pwd=1`    | fewer     |\n| `pwd=0`    | none      |\n\n+ the interval of iterations at which disturbances begin and end respectively. The intervals will be defined as following (integers only, and between 0 and 100):\n\n`int=20,60`: in this case, perturbations will start after 20% of iterations, and will stop after 60% of iterations.\n\nAn example of disturbance annotation is presented in the following screenshot:\n\n![](http://nodys.github.io/logml/images/pert-nodes-annotation.png)\n\n### Run Logml\n\n```bash\nlogml --help\n\n    Usage: logml <input>\n\n    Options:\n\n      -h, --help             Output usage information\n      -V, --version          Output the version number\n      -d, --dolphin          Output an human readable version of the parsed graph\n      -i, --iterations <n>   The number of iterations performed during a run\n      -o, --output <folder>  The output folder\n      -w, --watch            Watch for any changes and update the output (if input is a file)\n      -v, --verbose          Print out informations on build (activate --verbose)\n      -s, --server [port]    Create a plotting server (activate --verbose)\n      -p, --open             Open url on start\n      -f --faster            Prevent some size optimisation, faster, bigger (stronger)\n      --silent               Prevent verbose mode\n```\n\n## Example\n\nWe used the following Logml command with the `example.graphml`:\n\n```bash\nlogml example.graphml -o ./tmp -wsvp\n```\n\nAnd we obtained the following output result:\n\n![](http://nodys.github.io/logml/images/plot.png)\n\n---\n\nLicense: [MIT](./LICENSE) - Novadiscovery\n\n[![js-standard-style](https://cdn.rawgit.com/feross/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/feross/standard)\n",
