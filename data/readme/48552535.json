  "README": "These data have been generated using FORNAX.  See Wallace, Burrows,\nand Dolence (arxiv:1512.01338) for details.\n\nThere are two types of files available. At this directory level are\nfiles that provide the values for the energy bins of each neutrino type.\nThese are of the form *_energy_bins.txt. The first commented line of each \nfile has listed the minimum and maximum energies used in the energy groups,\nfollowed by two columns of data.  The first column is the energy group bin \ncenter, and the second column is the energy group bin width.  There are \n40 energy groups There are three of these files, one for each neutrino type:\n\nnue - electron neutrinos\nnua - anti-electron neutrinos\nnux - the \"nu_x\" neutrinos: muon and tau neutrions and their antiparticles\n\nThe other file type that is available is in the next level of directories.  \nThere are five of these directories, one for each progenitor model. Within \neach directory are the spectra data for each neutrino type for the \ncorresponding progenitor model.  Each file corresponds to a specific time \nin the simulation, as can be seen in the file names.\n\n'nu_spectra.t_002.dat'  is a file containing spectral data at a time 2 ms\nafter the time of maximum energy luminosity.\n\n'nu_spectra.t_n029.dat'  is a file containing spectral data at a time 29 ms\n*before* the time of maximum energy luminosity.  The 'n' prior to the number \nin the file name stands for 'negative'.\n\nThere are three columns in each file, corresponding to data for each neutrino \ntype: electron, anti-electron, and \"nu_x\" neutrinos, in that order.  There \nare 40 rows of data, corresponding to the 40 energy groups.  The data are \nthe energy luminosity (not flux) spectral density for the given neutrino\ntype in the given energy bin.  \n\n*Note:  The units are 10^51 erg/s/MeV*",
