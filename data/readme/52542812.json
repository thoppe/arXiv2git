  "README.md": "# Hand Writing RNN\n\nThis RNN is a reconstruction of Alex Graves' work presented in his paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.0850\n\n## Model\n\nThe model is precisely the same as the one presented in the paper above. Essentially, this is an RNN with three\nLSTM layers, a windowing layer that learns attention for each character in the input string, and a mixture of\nGaussians criterion layer.\n\nTo train the model:\n```\nth driver.lua -inputSize INPUT_DIMENSION -hiddenSize LSTM_UNIT_SIZE \n-lr LEARNING_RATE -maxlen MAXIMUM_NUMBER_OF_TIMESTEPS \n-batchSize BATCH_SIZE_OF_DATA -numPasses NUMBER_OF_PASSES\n-valData PATH_TO_VALIDATION_DATA -trainData PATH_TO_TRAINING_DATA\n```\n\nExplore driver.lua for command options. Including specifying a validation and training set. Currently toy.t7 is provided, but a larger training set can be created by downloading the IAM handwriting database and following the directions in Graves' paper: http://www.fki.inf.unibe.ch/databases/iam-on-line-handwriting-database\n\n## Results\n\n* Each multicolored line represents a new pen stroke.\n\n```\nth testNet.lua -string 'How are you today'\n```\n![alt tag](https://github.com/jarmstrong2/handwritingnet/blob/master/samples/howareyoutoday.png)\n\n```\nth testNet.lua -string 'Testing testing'\n```\n![alt tag](https://github.com/jarmstrong2/handwritingnet/blob/master/samples/testingtesting.png)\n\n```\nth testNet.lua -string 'this is awesome'\n```\n![alt tag](https://github.com/jarmstrong2/handwritingnet/blob/master/samples/thisisawesome.png)\n\n* Below is the attention plot which represents by how many timesteps the model will focus on a certain character in the string 'this is awesome' (moving in a left to right direction along each character in the string)\n\n![alt tag](https://github.com/jarmstrong2/handwritingnet/blob/master/samples/thisisawesome_attention.png)\n",
