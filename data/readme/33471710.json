The\nnumber of substitutes is controlled by two parameters: -n specifies\nthe number of substitutes for each word, -p specifies a threshold on\nthe sum of the substitute probabilities.  The program stops generating\nsubstitutes for a word when either limit is satisfied.  The output has\nan input word and its substitutes with unnormalized log probabilities\nin the following format:\n\nword <tab> sub1 <space> lprob1 <tab> sub2 <space> lprob2 <tab> ...\n\nPlease see the file LICENSE for terms of use.  A description of the\nalgorithm can be found in http://arxiv.org/abs/1205.5407v1.  To\ncompile you need the glib2 library.  Otherwise everything is standard\nC, so just typing make should give you an executable.\n",
