  "README": "For more information consult a preprint at the following link: http://arxiv.org/abs/1501.04948 \n\n### To compile:\n1. Select the compiler (CC) in Makefile.inc (tested on clang version 3.4-1ubuntu3).\n2. Set the path to Boost (INCLUDE) in Makefile.inc (tested on Boost 1.57).\n3. Select the debug or release version (OPTFLAGS) in Makefile.inc.\n4. Tweak the parameters in src/main/params.hpp.\n5. Type \"make\".\n\n### To use:\n1. The executable path is build/main.\n2. Usage: build/main [dict] [opt: queries]\n   The first parameter is a text file with the input (the database of keywords). Any whitespace is a default separator for words.\n   The second parameter is a text file with queries. If not supplied, queries are randomly generated from the input.\n3. Optionally, set INPUT and QUERIES in Makefile.inc and type \"make run\".\n4. The executable will print the sizes (input after filtering and index size) and the elapsed time.\n\n### To test for correctness:\n1. Set the index you want to check in src/main/params.hpp.\n2. Set the same k in testing/naive_hamming.py (hamK).\n3. Set the same minWordLength in testing/naive_hamming.py and src/main/params.hpp.\n4. Type \"make rebuild\" in the main folder.\n5. Set the paths in testing/run_and_compare.sh.\n6. Go to testing and type \"./run_and_compare.sh\".\n",
