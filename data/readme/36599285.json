I wrote this simulator while preparing my M.Sc. thesis with a hope that this might be used as a standard MD simulator for active systems \n\nFEATURES\n* Models activity through a ABP model by Marchetti & Hagan (see http://arxiv.org/pdf/1207.1737.pdf). \n* Can be extened for other ABP models as well (Vischek model for instance).\n* Parallelization is achived by decomposing the domain (so called \"cell list\" technique) and is handled by MPI. \n* Scalable and massively parallel\n\nTODO\n* Code cleanup\n* Add some shared memory parallelism using openMP.\n* Is it a really good idea to use the vector container from C++ STL for high performance codes?\n* Improvement of I/O patterns\n* Modification of existing data structure for particle to reduce disk usage. \n\nCOMPILING & BUILDING \n* You will need MPICH libraries to compile this. In ubuntu, get it with sudo apt-get install mpich2\n* mpic++ *.cpp -o md.x -std=c++11 -O3 -march=native\n\nSAMPLE USAGE\n* mpirun -np 48 ./md.x < some_input.txt > some_output.txt\n\nINPUT FORMAT\n```\n\n** parallel MD input **\n\nn_blocks_x -> 4;\n\nstart_mode -> \"load\"; \ninput_data_path -> \"/media/theo_xubuntu/old_backup/128f_eq\";\n\noutput_data_path -> \"try_io\"; \n\nnx -> 32;\nny -> 32;\n\nrho -> 1.1;\nsigma -> 1.0;\nrc -> 1.122;\nPe -> 99.9994;\n\nis_confined -> 0;\n\nmax_time_steps -> 10000;\ndt -> 1e-5;\nconfig_save_interval -> 20;\nwait_for_equilibration -> 10;\n\ndebug_type -> \"none\";\n```\n",
