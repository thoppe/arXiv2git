Most of it should work but it's still a little unpolished and you'll probably find some bugs. Use at your own risk :)\n\nNote that Telescope is distributed under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)\n\n### Getting Started\n\nNote that while simply cloning this repository will work, it is recommended you clone the [sample project](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/sample-project/) repository instead for a simpler workflow.\n\nPlease refer to [the documentation](http://telescope.readme.io/v0.20/docs/installing-telescope) for more instructions on installing Telescope.\n\n### Learn More\n\n- [Homepage](http://telescopeapp.org)\n- [Demo](http://demo2.telescopeapp.org)\n- [Sample Project](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/sample-project/)\n- [Documentation](http://telescope.readme.io)\n- [Roadmap](https://trello.com/b/oLMMqjVL/telescope-roadmap)\n- [Slack](http://slack.telescopeapp.org/)\n- [Meta](http://meta.telescopeapp.org/) - Discussions about Telescope", 
  "README.nitrous.md": "# Setup for Nitrous.IO\n\nBefore you can run this project, you will need to install Meteor with Autoparts (open-source package manager built specifically for Nitrous.IO boxes).\n\nRun the following commands in the Terminal below:\n\n1. `cd ~/workspace/Telescope/`\n2. `parts install meteor`\n3. `meteor -p 0.0.0.0:3000`\n\nUsually you would just run `meteor`, but for nitrous environment host `0.0.0.0` is required.\n\nTo preview the app, go to the \"Preview Menu\" and click \"Port 3000\"\n",

  "README.md": "# GitXiv\n[GitXiv.com](https://gitxiv.com/) - Collaborative Open Computer Science \n\n## About\nIn recent years, a highly interesting pattern has emerged: Computer scientists release new research findings on arXiv and just days later, developers release an open-source implementation on GitHub. This pattern is immensely powerful. One could call it collaborative open computer science (cocs).\n\n**GitXiv** is a space to share links to open computer science projects. Countless Github and arXiv links are floating around the web. Its hard to keep track of these gems. GitXiv attempts to solve this problem by offering a collaboratively curated feed of projects. Each project is conveniently presented as **arXiv + Github + Links + Discussion**. Members can submit their findings and let the community rank and discuss it. A regular newsletter makes it easy to stay up-to-date on recent advancements. It's free and open.\n\n## Wiki\n- The aim is, to keep the site as open as possible and let the community shape its future.  \n- Check the [GitXiv wiki](https://github.com/samim23/GitXiv/wiki), where we discuss ideas and collaborate.\n\n## Dependencies\n- [Telescope](https://github.com/TelescopeJS/Telescope)  \n- [Meteor](https://github.com/meteor/meteor)  \n- [Node](https://github.com/nodejs/node)  \n\n\n"
