  "README.md": "# ParseNet: Looking Wider to See Better\n\nBy Wei Liu, Andrew Rabinovich, and Alex Berg.\n\n### Introduction\n\nParseNet is a unified framework for semantic segmentation with CNN. You can use the package to train/evaluate a network for segmentation. For more details, please refer to our [arXiv paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.04579).\n\n### Citing ParseNet\n\nPlease cite ParseNet in your publications if it helps your research:\n\n    @article{liu15parsenet,\n      Author = {Liu, Wei and Rabinovich, Andrew and Berg, Alexander},\n      Journal = {arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.04579},\n      Title = {ParseNet: Looking Wider to See Better},\n      Year = {2015}\n    }\n\n### Contents\n1. [Installation](#installation)\n2. [Model](#model)\n\n### Installation\n1. Get the code\n  ```Shell\n  git clone https://github.com/weiliu89/caffe.git\n  cd caffe\n  git checkout fcn\n  ```\n\n2. Build the code. Please follow [Caffe instruction](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html) to install all necessary packages and build it.\n  ```Shell\n  make -j8\n  make mat\n  make py\n  make test -j8\n  make runtest -j8\n  ```\n\n  **Note:** Since ParseNet merges [#2016](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/pull/2016), which will cause a crash on exit. You can safely ignore it as it is a known side effect.\n\n    syncedmem.cpp:16] Check failed: error == cudaSuccess (29 vs. 0) driver shutting down\n\n### Model\nThe ParseNet model and solver on PASCAL has been shared at the [Caffe's Model Zoo](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/wiki/Model-Zoo). Please check it out for more details.\n",
