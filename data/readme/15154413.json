  "README.md": "LibBi package: PeriodicDriftBridge\n==================================\n\nSynopsis\n--------\n\n    ./init.sh\n\nThis simulates a number of data sets for testing and fits the bridge weight\nfunction. GNU Octave is required. Running it is optional, as a number of\nsimulated data sets are already included.\n\n    ./run.sh\n    \nThis runs a particle filter as well as samples from the posterior distribution\nfor a fixed data set of four observations given in Lin, Chen & Mykland (2010).\n\n    ./test.sh\n\nThis runs tests on the bootstrap and bridge particle filters on the simulated\ndata sets. Alternatively, these tests may be run as an array job on a cluster:\n\n    qsub -t 0-15 qsub_test_bridge.sh\n    qsub -t 0-15 qsub_test_bootstrap.sh\n    qsub -t 0-15 qsub_test_exact.sh\n\nThe last line computes normalising constants to be used as \"exact\" values\nwhen computing the MSE metric for comparison plots.\n\nFinally, results may be plot with:\n\n    octave --path oct/ --eval \"plot_and_print\"\n\nGNU Octave and OctBi are required.\n    \nNote that, as of version 1.1.0 of LibBi, running any of these gives the\nwarnings:\n\n    Warning (line 29): 'obs' variables should not appear on the right side of actions in the 'transition' block.\n    Warning (line 42): 'obs' variables should not appear on the right side of actions in the 'lookahead_transition' block.\n\nThis is normal.\n\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nThis package implements the periodic drift diffusion process introduced in\nBeskos et al. (2006) and further studied in Lin, Chen & Mykland (2010). The\nform of the process model is the Ito stochastic differential\nequation:\n\n$$dx=\\sin(x-\\pi)\\, dt+dW.$$\n\nThe task is to simulate diffusion bridges between the observed values. It was\nused as a test case in Del Moral & Murray (2014). The package may be used to\nreproduce the results in that paper.\n\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nBeskos, A.; Papaspiliopoulos, O.; Roberts, G. & Fearnhead, P.
