  "README.md": "# VQA Question-Classification\nUsing CNN to clasify questions into two categories i.e questions on common objects(like chair, bed, etc) and questions on abstract things(sand, mountain, etc).\n\nRuns on Python 2.7 and Theano 0.6\n\nModified from https://github.com/yoonkim/CNN_sentence\n\nInstructions:\n\nFirst\n\nrun python extract_ques.py MultipleChoice_mscoco_train2014_questions.json\n\nIt extracts questions from JSON filegiven as argument to txt file for further processing.\n\nThen,\n\nrun python process_data.py GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin\n\nThis file processes the datasets files. It uses the word2vec model to convert word to word vectors. Argument must point to GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin file. Downloadable from https://code.google.com/p/word2vec/.\n\nThen,\n\nrun python conv_net_question.py -nonstatic -rand num\n\nrun python conv_net_question.py -static -word2vec num\n\nrun python conv_net_question.py -nonstatic -word2vec num\n\nIt trains a CNN model to classify questions on common objects. The output of this run is two files named commonquestions.txt and uncommonquestions.txt.\n\nThis will run the CNN-rand, CNN-static, and CNN-nonstatic models respectively from the paper http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.5882.\n\nNote : num is number of example from VQA dataset that you want to classify and use -nonstatic and -word2vec for best results.\n\nAbout the datasets:-\n\n1)MultipleChoice_mscoco_train2014_questions.json is question set from VQA dataset.\n\n2)commonobject file contains examples of common object questions. It contains persons, entity and location classes from Question classification dataset(http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/Data/QA/QC/).\n\n3)uncommonobject contains examples of uncommon object questions. It contains description and abbreviation classes from Question classification dataset.\n",
