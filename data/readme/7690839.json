  "README.md": "rowavedt : Robust (Semi-parametric) Wavelet-based Event Detection\n================================================================================ \n\nThis package provides the core routines from Blocker and Protopapas 2012\n([arXiv:1301.3027 [stat.AP]](http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3027)). It includes the\nPX-EM algorithm for estimation of the semi-parametric model presented in that\npaper, as well as R scripts for the construction of the wavelet basis,\nfrequency-based screening for time series with interesting variation, and\nconstruction of features for subsequent classification.\n\nCode for the training and use of the classifier is not included. The former used\nexisting techniques from the [arm](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/arm/)\npackage for R in combination with scientific simulations (which are not easily\ngeneralized to other uses). The latter is straightforward, once the features are\nconstructed and the classifier is trained.\n\nRequirements\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis package is written for *nix systems, although it may work on Mac as well\n(untested). The core estimation code (written in C) requires a BLAS library with\n[LAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/lapack/) configured and the [GNU Science\nLibrary](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/). The\n[ATLAS](http://math-atlas.sourceforge.net/) and\n[Intel MKL](http://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mkl/) BLAS libraries have been\ntested successfully, and compilation options for both are included in the\nMakefile. Compilation requires [gcc](http://gcc.gnu.org/) and\n[glibc](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/).\n\nAll R scripts require the\n[optparse](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/optparse/) package. The script\nto construct wavelet basis matrices (`mk_wavelet_basis.R`) requires the\n[wavethresh](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wavethresh/) package as\nwell.\n\n\nInstallation\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTo compile and install the core estimation routine (written in C), first edit\nthe included Makefile as needed. The entries that may require modification are:\n  * `INSTALLDIR`: Directory that binary will be copied to by `make install`\n  * `LIBS`: Libraries included in compilation and linking. Standard entries for\n     ATLAS and LAPACK are included.\n  * `INCLUDES`: Include options for header files. Default for GSL and ATLAS are\n    included.\n  * `CFLAGS`: Additional arguments to pass to gcc. Defaults to `-O3 -Wall`\n\nNext, running `make all` from the package's root directory will produce the\n`rowavedt` binary. To test this using the data provided in the `data` directory,\nrun `make test`. This will produce `test/output.txt`.\n\nFinally, to install the `rowavedt` binary to `INSTALLDIR`, run `make install`\n(as root, if necessary).\n\nThe R scripts `mk_wavelet_basis.R`, `screen_time_series.R`, and\n`compute_features.R` can all be used directly from the `scripts/` directory via\n`Rscript`.\n\nUsage\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe workflow is: construct a basis matrix using `mk_wavelet_basis.R`, use this\nbasis matrix to fit the semi-parametric model to the time series of interest\nusing `rowavedt` (likely with using a customized wrapper script for your\ndataset), then screen for variation at interesting scales using\n`screen_time_series.R`.\n\nAll scripts and files have help and usage information available with the `-h`\ncommand line option. A few key points:\n  * Inputs to `rowavedt` need to be space-delimited text. For the time series\n    files (`DATAFILE`), the default is to have observation times in the first\n    column and observed values in the second. These can be changed via the `-t`\n    and `-c` options, respectively.\n  * `rowavedt` and `mk_wavelet_basis.R` write their output to stdout, but\n    `screen_time_series.R` writes its output to two files specified as\n    arguments to accommodate a separate output for detection statistics.\n  * `compute_features.R` requires both the output from `rowavedt` and the basis\n    matrix as inputs. If you use the `--detections` option with this script, be\n    careful to sort both the detections file (as output by\n    `screen_time_series.R`) and the output from `rowavedt` by their ID column.\n    If you sort the output from `rowavedt` before sending it to\n    `screen_time_series.R`, the former will be automatic.\n\n",
