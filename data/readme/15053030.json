The model is implemented in C and comes with Python API. The following files and directories are included in the root directory:\n\n- [toyproblem](toyproblem) A toy problem benchmarking Python, Cython, and C implementations of circleangle(), the function calculating $\\beta$;\n- [COPYING](COPYING) the GNU General Public License;\n- [Makefile](Makefile) makefile for generating toycython.so and toyc.so;\n- [README.md](README.md) this file;\n- [spotrod.c](spotrod.c) C implementation of the model;\n- [spotrod.h](spotrod.h) headers for functions in spotrod.c;\n- [spotrod-python-wrapper.c](spotrod-python-wrapper.c) C code wrapping spotrod.c in the numpy C API;\n- [spotrod-setup.py](spotrod-setup.py) a Python script for compiling spotrod.so;\n- [test.py](test.py) a minimal script generating a model lightcurve;\n- [test.png](test.png) output of minimal script;\n- [mcmc.py](mcmc.py) an MCMC simulation using the [emcee](http://dan.iel.fm/emcee/) package, creating an animation.\n\n## Compilation\n\nTo generate the module `spotrod.so`, run `make` without any arguments.\n\n## Citation\n\nIf you use `spotrod` in a publication, please consider citing [Beky, Kipping, and Holman, 2014, arXiv:1407.4465](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014arXiv1407.4465B).\n",
