  "README.md": "PSL\n===\n\nProbabilistic soft logic (PSL) is a probabilistic programming language for reasoning about\nrelational and structured data that is designed to be highly scalable. More information about PSL\nis available at the [PSL homepage](http://psl.cs.umd.edu).\n\nBuilding Models\n---------------\n\nIf you want to use PSL to build models, you probably do not need this source code. Instead,\nvisit the [Getting Started guide](https://github.com/linqs/psl/wiki/Getting-started) to learn\nhow to create PSL projects that will automatically install a stable version of these libraries.\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nIf you do want to install PSL from source, you can use [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) 3.x.\nIn the top-level directory of the PSL source (which should be the same directory that holds this\nREADME), run\n\n\tmvn install\n\nCiting PSL\n----------\n\nWe hope you find PSL useful!
