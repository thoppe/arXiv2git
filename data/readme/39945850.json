Optimal directional matched filters (MF) and scale\n     adaptive filters (SAF) may be constructed from a template and\n     stochastic background process. Functionality is incorporated also\n     to filter a sky data map using an optimal filter and to detect\n     compact objects using a naive thresholding strategy.\n\nVERSION\n     Release 1.1\n\nAUTHORS\n     J.
