  "README.rst": "ADS to BibDesk\n==============\n\nThis is the command line edition of ADS to BibDesk, a tool for retrieving the bibtex, abstract and PDF of an astronomical journal article published on `ADS <http://adsabs.harvard.edu>`_ or `arXiv.org <http://arxiv.org/archive/astro-ph>`_ and add it to your `BibDesk <http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/>`_ database.\n\nADS to BibDesk is a tool for retrieving the bibtex, abstract and PDF of an astronomical journal article published on `ADS <http://adsabs.harvard.edu>`_ or `arXiv.org <http://arxiv.org/archive/astro-ph>`_ and adding it to your `BibDesk <http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/>`_ database.\n\nADS to BibDesk comes in two flavours: an Automator Service that you can use to grab papers in any app (e.g., in Safari, or Mail), or a command line app.\n\n*Developers:* please read the `CONTRIBUTING <https://github.com/jonathansick/ads_bibdesk/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md>`_ document for details on how to build the ADS to BibDesk CLI/Service from source, make changes, and submit pull requests.\n\nCommand Line Quickstart\n-----------------------\n\nADS to BibDesk can also be run directly from the command line.\nThe command line script can be installed via::\n\n    python setup.py install\n\nYou may need to run the last command with `sudo`.\n\nOnce `adsbibdesk` is installed, you can call it with the same types of article tokens you can launch the Service with, e.g.,::\n\n    adsbibdesk 1998ApJ...500..525S\n\nA full summary of `adsbibdesk` commands is available via::\n\n    adsbibdesk --help\n\nSummary of article tokens\n-------------------------\n\n* The URL of an ADS or arXiv article page,\n* The ADS bibcode of an article (e.g. `1998ApJ...500..525S`),\n* The arXiv identifier of an article (e.g. `0911.4956`), or\n* An article DOI.\n\nOther Modes\n-----------\n\nBesides the primary mode (adding a single paper to BibDesk, ADS to BibDesk has three other modes: previewing papers, updated preprints, and ingesting PDF archives into BibDesk.\n\nPreviewing Papers\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nUse the `-o` switch to simply download and view the PDF of an article without adding it to BibDesk. E.g.,::\n\n    adsbibdesk -o 1998ApJ...500..525S\n\nUpdating Preprints\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nRun ADS to BibDesk with the `-u` switch to find and update all astro-ph preprints in your BibDesk bibliography::\n\n    adsbibdesk -u\n\nTo restrict this update to a date range, you can use the `--from_date` (`-f`) and `--to_date` (`-t`) flags with dates in `MM/YY` format. For example, to update preprints published in 2012, run::\n\n    adsbibdesk -u --from_date=01/12 --to_date=12/12\n\nNote that this operation can take some time since we throttle requests to ADS to be a nicer robot.\n\nPDF Ingest Mode\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nWith the command-line ADS to BibDesk, you can ingest a folder of PDFs that originated from ADS into BibDesk.\nThis is great for users who have amassed a literature folder, but are just starting to use BibDesk.\nThis will get you started quickly.\n\nYou need the program `pdf2json <http://code.google.com/p/pdf2json/>`_ to use\nthis script. The easiest way to get pdf2json and its dependencies is through\n`Homebrew <http://mxcl.github.com/homebrew/>`_, the Mac package manager.\nOnce homebrew is setup, simply run `brew install pdf2json`.\n\nTo run this workflow,::\n\n    adsbibdesk -p my_pdf_dir/\n\nwhere `my_pdf_dir/` is a directory containing PDFs that you want to ingest.\n\nNote that this workflow relies on a DOI existing in the PDF.\nAs such, it will not identify astro-ph pre-prints, or published papers older than a few years.\nTypically the DOI is published on the first page of modern papers.\nThis method was inspired by a script by `Dr Lucy Lim <http://www.mit.edu/people/lucylim/BibDesk.html>`_.\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nCopyright 2014 Jonathan Sick, Rui Pereira and Dan-Foreman Mackey\n\nADS to BibDesk is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nADS to BibDesk is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
