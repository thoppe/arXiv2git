  "README.md": "Discriminative Patches\n======================\n\nThis repository contains code for the following paper\n\nSaurabh Singh, Abhinav Gupta and Alexei A. Efros. *\"Unsupervised Discovery of\nMid-Level Discriminative Patches.\"* In European Conference on Computer Vision\n(2012). (arXiv:1205.3137) http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/projects/discriminativePatches/\n\nAll Rights Reserved @ saurabh.me@gmail.com (Saurabh Singh).\n\n\nSetup\n=====\n\n1. Git clone this repository (if you are reading this on git-hub).\n2. Download the pre-trained models from the [project website](http://graphics.cs.cmu.edu/projects/discriminativePatches/) and un-compress the\nfile in the root directory of the repository, i.e. as a sibling to the 'code'\ndirectory.\n3. Modify the setmeup.m file to make USR.imgDir and USR.modelDir point to the\nmodels directory.\n4. cd to code/features directory and run 'mex features.cc' from the matlab prompt.\n(This is assuming you have mex already setup).  \n\nBasic Usage\n===========\n\nA script that demonstrates how to run pre-trained models is provided in the\n'code/user' directory. Simply cd to 'code' directory in repository and run the\nfollowing commands on the matlab prompt. \n\n    >> setmeup\n    >> detectDiscPats\n\nTraining The Patches\n====================\n\nStart by taking a look at\n[setmeup.m](https://github.com/saurabhme/discriminative-patches/blob/master/code/setmeup.m)\nfor required libraries and \n[trainDiscPats.m](https://github.com/saurabhme/discriminative-patches/blob/master/code/user/trainDiscPats.m).\nThis script runs a training job for the pascal sub-dataset used in paper. Pay\nattention to the comments related to run time. To run on your own dataset create\na script similar to\n[getPascalData.m](https://github.com/saurabhme/discriminative-patches/blob/master/code/datasets/pascal/getPascalData.m)\nthat generates the required metadata.\n\n\nAcknowledgements\n================\nSome of the code pieces are borrowed from other sources. Following should be an\nexhaustive list of those. It is recommended to get the latest libraries from\nthese sources to remain upto-date with the improvements.\n\n* The features.cc file has been borrowed from the following code-base and\ncorresponds to the version 4 release.\n[_Discriminatively trained deformable part models_](http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~rbg/latent/)\n\n",
