To modify the source code, you're required to rebuild the makefile with CMake. \n\n2.About the program:\n\nCurrent version of Magnon can be used to solve the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation in two-dimensional square/ hexagonal magnetic superlattice with circle or ellipse cross-section. Based on the eigenvalues and eigenvectors from LLG, associated Green functions and time response of spin wave pulse can be achieved. With the solved band structure, density of states of magnon and vector plot of total magnetic/electric field can be calculated. For more theoretical derivation, please refer to the following paper:\n\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1111.2506\n",
