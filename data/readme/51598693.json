Then run `.\\scripts\\installCuDNN.ps1 $downloadedZipFile` in PowerShell where `$downloadedZipFile` is the path to your downloaded cuDNN file. Example: `.\\scripts\\installCuDNN.ps1 ~\\Downloads\\cudnn-7.0-win-x64-v3.0-prod.zip`\n\nNow, you should be able to build `caffe.sln` \n\n## Development\n\n### Common issues when pulling new commits from BVLC's branch\n- Remove `src\\caffe\\proto\\caffe.pb.h` file before compiling so that new the new file can be regenerated.\n- If linking fails: it's likely that there are new `cpp` files that need to be added to the `caffelib` project.\n\n## License and Citation\n\nCaffe is released under the [BSD 2-Clause license](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/blob/master/LICENSE).\nThe BVLC reference models are released for unrestricted use.\n\nPlease cite Caffe in your publications if it helps your research:\n\n    @article{jia2014caffe,\n      Author = {Jia, Yangqing and Shelhamer, Evan and Donahue, Jeff and Karayev, Sergey and Long, Jonathan and Girshick, Ross and Guadarrama, Sergio and Darrell, Trevor},\n      Journal = {arXiv preprint arXiv:1408.5093},\n      Title = {Caffe: Convolutional Architecture for Fast Feature Embedding},\n      Year = {2014}\n    }\n",
