  "README": "Retrieving WISE PSF Model\n=========================\nCheck out a copy of the WISE/pro and WISE/etc contents. The FITS files \ncontaining the PSF models are in WISE/etc. Set the WISE_DATA environment \nvariable to the directory in which you place these FITS files. To retrieve a \nPSF cutout, use wise_psf_cutout.pro.\n\nImportant Keywords\n==================\nFor historical reasons, all IDL routines apply to the Preliminary Release\nby default. As a result, it is necessary to set the allsky keyword to 1 when\nusing these IDL routines. The IDL routines default to W3. The \"bands\" keyword,\nan integer 1-4, now dictates the band of interest. For backward compatibility,\nthe w4 keyword still exists and sets band=4. If you're getting started and \njust want to inspect a fiducial PSF evaluated at the center of an L1b image\nin each band you should do the following:\n\n; ----- W1\npar1 = psf_par_struc(/allsky, band=1)\npsf1 = wise_psf_cutout(par1.crpix, par1.crpix, /bright, /allsky, band=1)\n\n; ----- W2\npar2 = psf_par_struc(/allsky, band=2)\npsf2 = wise_psf_cutout(par2.crpix, par2.crpix, /bright, /allsky, band=2)\n\n; ----- W3\npar3 = psf_par_struc(/allsky, band=3)\npsf3 = wise_psf_cutout(par3.crpix, par3.crpix, /bright, /allsky, band=3)\n\n; ----- W4\npar4 = psf_par_struc(/allsky, band=4)\npsf4 = wise_psf_cutout(par4.crpix, par4.crpix, /bright, /allsky, band=4)\n\nNotes on Fluxes and Magnitudes\n==============================\nThe flux of a point source with catalog magnitude w?mpro (in L1b DN) is given \nby:\n\nflux = 10^((magzp-w?mpro)/2.5)\n\nWhere magzp is given by the parameter magzp in psf_par_struc.pro, and flux\nis measured in an aperture of radius 0.46 (0.92) arcmin in W3 (W4).\n\nLatent Model Details\n====================\nThe parameter latim (latim2) in psf_par_struc.pro gives the file name \ncontaining the first (second) latent model. These models are scaled to \nw?mpro = 0 for all bands. The first latent is nonlinear in parent\nsource flux, with amplitude given by:\n\namplitude(w?mpro) = corr*amplitude(w?mpro = 0)*10^(-w?mpro/2.5)\n\nWhere corr is a scalar correction factor that can be retrieved using \nlatent_nonlin_corr.pro. Such a nonlinearity correction coefficient\nwas found to be unnecessary for the second latent model in both W3, W4.\n\nThe first latent is much less pronounced in W1, W2 than in W3, W4 and\nlooks qualitatively different. Nevertheless, I have created a model\nanalogous to those in W3, W4 that can be accessed in the same way. The W1, W2 \nsecond latents have not been modeled since these weak feature are very poorly \ndetected in single exposures, even for the very brightest high-latitude \nsources.\n\nRevised W1, W2 v1 PSFs\n======================\nSince, in certain regions near the W1/W2 PSF core it became clear that \nthird order polynomials did not adequately capture the PSF variation, I have\ncreated revised PSFs that incorporate higher order polynomial coefficients (up\nto fifth order) in x,y. These models are etc/psf_coeff-w?.v1.fits, and I \nrecommend these be used rather than the earlier PSF models. wise_psf_cutout.pro\nnow uses the v1 models by default, but is backwards compatible so that \nreverting the psf_par_struc.pro parameter fpsf to its previous value of \npsf_coeff-w?.fits makes use of the original third order W1/W2 PSF models.\n\nAttribution\n===========\nIf you use these PSFs in your published research, please cite:\n\nMeisner & Finkbeiner, ApJ, 781, 5 (2014)\n\n@ARTICLE{2014ApJ...781....5M,\n   author = {{Meisner}, A.~M. and {Finkbeiner}, D.~P.},\n    title = \"{A Full-sky, High-resolution Atlas of Galactic 12 {$\\mu$}m Dust Emission with WISE}\",\n  journal = {\\apj},\narchivePrefix = \"arXiv\",\n   eprint = {1312.0947},\n primaryClass = \"astro-ph.IM\",\n keywords = {dust, extinction, infrared: ISM, ISM: structure },\n     year = 2014,\n    month = jan,\n   volume = 781,\n      eid = {5},\n    pages = {5},\n      doi = {10.1088/0004-637X/781/1/5},\n   adsurl = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014ApJ...781....5M},\n  adsnote = {Provided by the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System}\n}\n",
