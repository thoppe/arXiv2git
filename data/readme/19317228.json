Zuluaga, UdeA**) with\nProf. **Paul Mason** (NMSU) and their former graduate and\nundergraduate students Dr. Pablo A. Cuartas-Restrepo and Joni Clark.\nIt arose from the interest of our team (internally dubbed as the *BHM\nMafia*) in the complex and rich conditions that potentially habitable\nplanets could have while orbiting moderately separated binaries\n(binary periods under 60 days).\n\nThis is a tool that can be used as a web app or a python package.  The\ntool is entirely programmed in python and php (web interface) and it\nintends to be as friendly as possible to astronomers working in this\nfield.\n\nIf you need to cite this software please include a reference to one\n(or all) of the following papers:\n\n- Mason, P. A., Zuluaga, J. I., Clark, J. M., & Cuartas-Restrepo,\n  P. A. (2013). Rotational Synchronization May Enhance Habitability\n  for Circumbinary Planets: Kepler Binary Case Studies.

The first (and more primitive version) located in the trunk\nof this project (master branch).  And the newest (experimental but\nmore flexible and faster) version which is presently located in the\n`BHMcalc2` branch.\n\nFor getting the lattest version please follow the instructions below.\n\nThe first version is not anymore maintained so it is not as\nrecommended as the newest version.\n\nGetting a copy\n--------------\n\nTo get a copy of the newest version of this project just execute:\n\n```\n$ git clone --branch BHMcalc2 http://github.com/facom/BHMcalc.git\n```\n\nFor the oldest version just remove the `--branch` option.\n\nInstructions for the contirbutor\n--------------------------------\n\n1. Generate a public key of your account at the client where you will\n   develop contributions:\n   \n   ```\n   $ ssh-keygen -t rsa -C \"user@email\"\n   ```\n\n2. Upload public key to the github FACom repository (only authorized\n   for the FACom repository manager), https://github.com/facom.\n\n3. Configure git at the client:\n\n   ```\n   $ git config --global user.name \"Your Name\"\n   $ git config --global user.email \"your@email\"\n   ```\n\n4. Get an authorized clone of the project:\n\n   ```\n   $ git clone git@github.com:facom/BHMcalc.git\n   ```\n\n5. Checkout the branch you are interested in (e.g. BHMcalc2):\n\n   ```\n   $ git checkout -b BHMcalc2 origin/BHMcalc2\n   ```\n\n6. Checkout back into the master:\n\n   ```\n   $ git checkout master\n   ```\n\nLicensing\n---------\n\nThis project must be used and distributed under the [GPL License\nVersion 2] (http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html).\n\nAll wrongs reserved to [Jorge I.
