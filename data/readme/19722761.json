  "README.md": "**DGEclust** is a program for clustering and differential expression analysis of digital expression data\ngenerated by next-generation sequencing assays, such as RNA-seq, CAGE and others. It takes as input a table\nof count data and it estimates the number and parameters of the clusters supported by the data. At a later stage,\nthese can be used for identifying differentially expressed genes and for gene- and sample-wise clustering of the\noriginal data matrix. Internally, **DGEclust** uses a *Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Mixture Model* for modeling\nover-dispersed count data, combined with a *blocked Gibbs sampler* for efficient Bayesian learning.\n\nThis program is part of the software collection of the [Computational Genomics Group](http://bioinformatics.bris.ac.uk/)\nat the University of Bristol and it is under continuous development. You can find more technical details on the\nstatistical methodologies used in this software in the following papers:\n\n1. http://www.genomebiology.com/2015/16/1/39 (Vavoulis et al., *Genome Biology* 16:39,  **2014**)\n2. http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.4144 (Vavoulis & Gough, *J Comput Sci Syst Biol* 7:001-009, **2013**)\n\nFor more information, including bug reports, send an email to <Dimitris.Vavoulis@ndcls.ox.ac.uk> or <Julian.Gough@bristol.ac.uk>\n\nEnjoy!\n",
