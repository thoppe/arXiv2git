Gibson and and Jehoshua Bruck\n    The Journal of Physical Chemistry A 2000 104 (9), 1876-1889\n    DOI: 10.1021/jp993732q\n \nThe code needs to be compiled with a C compiler such as GCC (http://gcc.gnu.org/) and linked with the GNU Scientific Library (http://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) to works \n\nTo compil just use in a terminal the command \"gcc *.c -lgsl -lgslcblas -lm\" in the directory with soure files.\n\nSome functionality requier Gnulpot (http://www.gnuplot.info/) and ffmpeg (http://www.ffmpeg.org/).\n \nThe program is under licensed GNU GPLv3 (see a copy at http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html or in the directory).\nIt has been writting by E. Hingant (erwan 'at' mat.ufcg.edu.br) and R. Yvinec (romain.yvinec 'at' tours.inra.fr) between 2013 and 2015.\n\nE.H would thanks Fondecyt Grant 3130318 (Chile) and CAPES/IMPA (Brazil) for their support.\n",
