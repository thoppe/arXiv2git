These ship with the current version of RStudio (`>=0.98`). Additionally, a LaTeX environment is required to generate the output pdf.\n\n\n\nBuild the manuscript\n--------------------\n\n\n```r\nrmarkdown::render(\"manuscript.Rmd\")\n```\n\nor use the `knit2pdf` button in your RStudio console.\n\n\nAlternately: Using Docker\n-------------------------\n\nInstead of installing R packages seperately, you can try out `rgbif`\nby running RStudio in a Docker container.  This (a) avoids having to install\nsoftware dependencies, and (b) avoids altering anything on your local\nlibrary. If the above doesn't work, or just for fun, give this a try.\n\nThe `rgbif` package and all dependencies are installed on the [rocker/ropensci](http://registry.hub.docker.com/u/rocker/ropensci) Docker container.  You will still need all the files from this directory to build the manuscript. Users can decide to run either an R console (accessed through a terminal)\nor an RStudio instance (accessed through the browser) on the container.\n\n\n### Docker Installation\n\nIn a Mac or Windows machine, this will aslo install boot2docker\n(easy point & click install, ~24 MB). On Linux, this installs\nnatively and we can run everything in the terminal instead of in\nthe boot2docker window.\n([[Mac](https://docs.docker.com/installation/mac/)],\n[[Windows](https://docs.docker.com/installation/windows/),\n[[Linux](https://docs.docker.com/installation)]).\n\n### R console\n\nWith boot2docker running, run `R` on the `rocker/ropensci` image,\nlinking the location of your copy of this directory to\n`/home/rstudio` on the container, setting the container's\nworking directory to the same, and setting user as `rstudio`:\n\n```bash\ndocker run -v /path/to/rgbif:/home/rstudio \\\n  -w /home/rstudio -u rstudio -ti --rm rocker/ropensci R\n```\n\nAt the R prompt, you can use `rmarkdown` to render the manuscript PDF from the `Rmd` file:\n\n```r\nrmarkdown::render('manuscript.Rmd')\n```\n\n`manuscript.pdf` should now be created in the manuscripts directory.\n\n### Using RStudio\n\n1) From the command line (with boot2docker running on Mac/Windows), do:\n\n```bash\nsudo docker run -d -p 8787:8787 rocker/ropensci\n```\n\nThat will take a while to download the image the first time you run it.\n\n2) Once it is done, try:\n\n```bash\nboot2docker ip\n```\n\nthat should return an ip address you can paste into your browser.\n\n3) Add a `:8787` to the end of this address and paste it into your\nbrowser address bar. (e.g. it's probably `http://92.168.59.103:8787`\nbut that can change).\n\n4) You should get the RStudio welcome screen.  you should be able to\nlogin with user/password `rstudio/rstudio`.\n\n5) Clone the `msrgbif` repository from https://github.com/sckott/msrgbif, and you should be good to go as above.\n",
