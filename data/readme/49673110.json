  "README.md": "# EEGLearn\nA set of functions for supervised feature learning/classification of mental states from EEG based on \"EEG images\" idea.\nThis code can be used to construct sequence of images from ongoing EEG activities and to classify between different cognitive states through recurrent-convolutional neural\nnets.\n\n# Dependencies\nIn order to run this code you need to install the following modules:\n\nNumpy and Scipy (http://www.scipy.org/install.html)\n\nScikit-Learn (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html)\n\nTheano (http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install.html)\n\nLasagne (http://lasagne.readthedocs.org/en/latest/user/installation.html)\n\n\n\n#Reference\n\nIf you are using this code please cite our paper.\n\nBashivan, Pouya, et al. \"Learning Representations from EEG with Deep Recurrent-Convolutional Neural Networks.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.06448 (2015).\n\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06448",
