See\n\n  M.Donnellan, F.Knechtli, B.Leder and R.Sommer,\n  ``Determination of the Static Potential with Dynamical Fermions,''\n  Nucl. Phys. B 849 (2011) 45\n  arXiv:1012.3037 [hep-lat].\n\nfor details.\n\nThe currently supported boundary conditions are periodic and open. For a\ndescription of how-to run the program and the output see the README in the\nmain subdirectory. \n\n\nPROGRAM FEATURES\n\nAll programs parallelize in 0,1,2,3 or 4 dimensions, depending on what is\nspecified at compilation time.\n\n\nOPENQCD PACKAGE\n\nAll programs use the openQCD package modules as library. The package has to\nbe present at compile time in a directory to be specified in the Makefile.\nThe currently supported version is openQCD-1.4.\n\n\nCOMPILATION\n\nThe compilation of the programs is in accordance with openQCD-1.4. See there for\ndetails.\n\n\nAUTHORS\n\nThe initial release of the wloop package was written by Bjorn Leder. Initial\nsupport for open boundary conditions was added by Jacob Finkenrath.\n\n\nACKNOWLEDGEMENTS\n\nAn early version of the code is based on a Wilson loop program by Nazario Tantalo.\n\n\nLICENSE\n\nThe software may be used under the terms of the GNU General Public Licence\n(GPL).\n\n\nBUG REPORTS\n\nIf a bug is discovered, please send a report to <leder@physik.hu-berlin.de>.\n\n \n",
