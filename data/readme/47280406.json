The algorithm builds upon the algorithm in [BGPS06] for the standard average consensus problem, with an additional step to propagate data in the network in a random walk fashion. This project aims to investigate whether a potentially faster gossip algorithm such as [Ols14] can be used in [CBSC15] to speed up the algorithm, both empirically and theoretically.\n\n**References**: \n\n* [CBSC15] I.
