  "readme.txt": "The Script is for multimodal task-driven classification using l_{12} prior (joint sparsity).\r\n\r\nIt performs dictionary learning (unsupervised and supervised) on training data. The optimal sparse codes generated are used as features for multimodal classification using quadratic loss function. It is straight forward to extend the code to cover other convex cost functions such as logistic regression. For more\r\ninformation see the paper below:\r\n\r\nMultimodal Task-Driven Dictionary Learning for Image Classification\r\nSoheil Bahrampour, Nasser M. Nasrabadi, Asok Ray, W. Kenneth Jenkins\nIEEE Transactions on Image Processing, vol.PP, no.99, pp.1-1\ndoi: 10.1109/TIP.2015.2496275\n\r\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1502.01094\r\n\r\nPlease cite above paper if you use this code.\r\n\r\nThe joint sparse coding is solved using ADMM algorithm. The algorithm is implemented in c to gain speed advantage and is linked hear using a mex file. Of course, one can use other optimization algorithms instead of ADMM. The mex file is compiled for 64 system with a custom architecture and it is not guaranteed that it can be used efficiently with other systems.\r\n\r\nUse the ClassificationMultiClassDecFusJoint.m file as the entry point.",
