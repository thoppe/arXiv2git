  "README": "Arc-flow Vector Packing Solver (VPSolver)\n\nCopyright (C) 2013-2015, Filipe Brandao\nFaculdade de Ciencias, Universidade do Porto\nPorto, Portugal. All rights reserved. E-mail: <fdabrandao@dcc.fc.up.pt>.\n\n--\nVPSolver is a vector packing solver based on an arc-flow formulation with graph\ncompression.  VPSolver generates very strong models (equivalent to Gilmore and\nGomory's) that can be solved using general-purpose mixed-integer programming\nsolvers such as Gurobi and GLPK. VPSolver does not explicitly require any MIP\nsolver in particular, though a good  MIP solver may be necessary for solving\nlarge models.\n\nFor more details, please refer to the manual.\n\n--\nProject Homepage: https://github.com/fdabrandao/vpsolver\nBitbucket Mirror: https://bitbucket.org/fdabrandao/vpsolver\n\n--\nRequirements:\n    MIP solver: Gurobi, CPLEX, GLPK, COIN-OR, SCIP, lp_solve, ...\n    Compiler: g++ >= 4.6\n    Python 2.7 for the python interface (optional)\n\nIt has been successfully compiled and run on the following platforms:\n    Linux\n    Mac OS X\n\nCompiling VPSolver: ./compile.sh\n\nPython setup: sudo python setup.py install\n\n--\nVPSolver includes several scripts for solving arc-flow models using different\nsolvers:\n    scripts/vpsolver_gurobi.sh  - Gurobi\n    scripts/vpsolver_cplex.sh   - IBM CPLEX\n    scripts/vpsolver_coinor.sh  - COIN-OR CBC\n    scripts/vpsolver_glpk.sh    - GLPK\n    scripts/vpsolver_scip.sh    - SCIP\n    scripts/vpsolver_lpsolve.sh - lp_solve\n\n--\nVPSolver includes several examples:\n    examples/example.sh - shell commands\n    examples/example.py - usage examples of pyvpsolver (the python interface)\n    examples/example_vbp.py - solves vector packing instances using pyvpsolver\n    examples/example_mvbp.py - solves multiple-choice vector packing instances\n    examples/example_vsbpp.py - solves variable-sized bin packing instances\n\n--\nFolders:\n    bin/        - vpsolver executables\n    scripts/    - vpsolver scripts\n    src/        - vpsolver source code in C++\n    pyvpsolver/ - pyvpsolver source code in Python 2.7\n    examples/   - vpsolver and pyvpsolver examples\n    reports/    - technical reports on the underlying algorithms and models\n\n--\nVPSolver was proposed in:\nBrandao, F. and Pedroso, J.
