  "README.md": "Utilities for tracing vortex lines\n==================================\n\nThis repo contains some utilities for finding vortices in a complex-valued\nfield sampled on a regular grid in 2D or 3D.  This is quite straightforward over\na 2D grid, but tracing vortex lines in 3D is a bit more involved.\n\nThe functions have resonably complete documentation comments, but here's an\noverview of the more interesting functions to get you started:\n\n\n3D functions\n------------\n\n* `vortex_lines_example.m` is an example script showing how to compute a 3D\n  visualization of the vortex lines passing through a 3D complex field.  Running\n  this and examining the code should give you an idea of where to start.\n\n* `vortex_trace_all()` traces all vortex lines through a 3D vorticity field\n  produced using `vortex_detct3d()`.\n\n\n2D functions\n------------\n\nFor a 2D grid, there are two functions of interest:\n\n* `phase_winding2d()` takes a 2D grid containing complex phase and detects grid\n  plaquetts where that phase \"winds\" around by 2 pi.\n\n* `vortex_detect2d()` takes a 2D complex field, and interpolates more exact\n  estimates of vortex position within the grid plaquetts.  Using this method as\n  part of the 3D vortex tracing gives much better results.\n\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nvortutils is licensed under the 2-clause BSD license: this basically means you\ncan do what you want with it, provided you keep the original attribution intact\n(see LICENSE.txt for details)\n\nThe code was originally written at The University of Queensland during Chris\nFoster's PhD (thesis resting in peace here: http://arxiv.org/abs/1302.0470).\n\n",
