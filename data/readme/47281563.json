  "README.txt": "About\n-----\nReinforcement learning with artificial neural networks in python. \n\nThis code is intended mainly as proof of concept of action-value learning by\nartificial neural networks, and was inspired by [1, 2]. \n\nThe implementations are not particularly clear, efficient, well tested \nor numerically stable. We advise against using this software for nondidactic \npurposes.\n\nThis software is licensed under the MIT License. \n\nAlgorithms\n----------\nQ-learning feedforward neural networks (cf. [1])\nQ-learning long short-term memory networks (cf. [2])\n\nExamples\n--------\nSee the examples directory.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n[1] Mnih, Volodymyr, Koray Kavukcuoglu, David Silver, Alex Graves, \nIoannis Antonoglou, Daan Wierstra, and Martin Riedmiller.
