Out of the box, the PHOBOS MC doesn't compile with ROOT 6.02/12, but does compile fine with ROOT 5.34/34. \n\nOther macros should be compatable with either ROOT 5 or ROOT 6.\n\n\n## PHOBOS Glauber MC ##\n\nThe PHOBOS Glauber MC was downloaded from [hepforge](https://tglaubermc.hepforge.org/). The supporting documentation can be found at [arXiv:1408.2549](http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.2549)\n\nThe `runAndSaveNtuple()` function has been modified to take an input `x` value. This modifies the interaction cross section as implemented in `TGlauberMC::CalcEvent()`\n\nThe output of the `runAndSaveNtuple()` function has also been modified and simplified. It now outputs a `TTree`, the branches are defined in the `TGlauberMC::Run()` function.\n\nTo run the Glauber MC for 1k p+Au collisions with x=0.1:\n\n    $ root\n    root [0] gSystem->Load(\"libMathMore\")\n    (int)0\n    root [1] .L runglauber_v2.2_C+\n    root [2] runAndSaveNtuple(1000, \"p\", \"Au\", 42, -1, 0.4, 0.1, \"testglauber.root\")\n    Setting up nucleus p\n    Setting up nucleus Au\n    Event # 950 x-sect = 1.79035 +- 0.0580562 b        \n    Done!\n    root [3] \n\n## calculate_RCP_dAuJet.C ##\n\nThis code calculates the ratio of the bias factors in 0-20% / 60-88% for a direct comparison with the PHENIX Run 8 d+Au Jet R_{CP} ([arXiv:1509.04657](http://inspirehep.net/search?p=find+eprint+1509.04657))\n\nIt uses a set of generated Glauber output trees for different `x` values, defined at the beginning of the code.\n\n\n## calculate_RCP.C ##\n\nThis code calculates the ratio of bias factors in different centrality bins for a set of systems (p+Au, d+Au, 3He+Au).\n\nIt uses a set of arrays defined at the beginning of the function for choosing `x` values, systems, and Glauber ROOT files.\n",
