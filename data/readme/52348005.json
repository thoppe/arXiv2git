  "readme.md": "#LSTMetallica\n\nA LSTM network that learns from the drum tracks of Metallica and generates new tracks.\n\n#### Prequisite\n * [keras](https://github.com/fchollet/keras), a deeplearning framework\n * [python-midi](https://github.com/vishnubob/python-midi) to get midi file\n * numpy - probably you already have it.\n\n#### Usage\n * Clond the repo\n * `$ python main_lstM_etallica.py` to get generated drum track in text file\n * text->midi: `$ python main_post_process.py` - this is when you need [python-midi](https://github.com/vishnubob/python-midi)\n * Use [this text file](https://github.com/keunwoochoi/LSTMetallica/blob/master/metallica_drums_text.txt), an aggregated-and-encoded text file for Metallica's drum tracks, to do something more\n * [This folder](https://github.com/keunwoochoi/LSTMetallica/tree/master/Metallica_drums_midi) contains the original drum midi tracks.\n \n#### External links\n * Details in my [blot post](https://keunwoochoi.wordpress.com/2016/02/23/lstmetallica/)\n * [Results on soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/kchoi-research/sets/lstmetallica-drums) and [+1 more result](https://soundcloud.com/kchoi-research/00-24-100-bonus-for-score)\n * Similar work on jazz chord progression: [repository](https://github.com/keunwoochoi/lstm_real_book/blob/master/README.md), [blog post](https://keunwoochoi.wordpress.com/2016/02/19/lstm-realbook/), [soundcloud](https://soundcloud.com/kchoi-research/sets/lstm-realbook-1-5)\n\n### Citation\n**Text-based LSTM networks for Automatic Music Composition**, Keunwoo Choi, George Fazekas, Mark Sandler, *1st Conference on Computer Simulation of Musical Creativity*, Huddersfield, UK, 2016, [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.05358#), [pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1604.05358v1)\n\n",
