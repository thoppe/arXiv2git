  "README.md": "# Deep Art fun\nLast weekend I finally took some of personal photos and artwork to *\"paint\"* them in, but not limited to, Van Gogh style. The \"painting\" part was actually an inspiring application from **Deep learning** research [1,2]. In short, the Deep learning model - a deep neural network - took your photo (referred as content-image henceforth) and a reference style (combination of 1 or more style-images) as the inputs and produce your photo in that style. A popular implementation of [1] is publicly provided [3]. \n\n## Demo\nHere we have the content-image is a photo of a walking path on the top-left, the style-image is an artwork by artist Leonid Afremov on the top-right, and the walking path generated in Afremov's style at the bottom.\n<br/>\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoamle/neural-style-example/master/content-imgs/exeter.jpg\" height=\"150\"> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoamle/neural-style-example/master/style-imgs/Afremov2.jpg\" height=\"150\">\n<br/>\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoamle/neural-style-example/master/visually-appealing/exeter-afremov2.png\" width=\"460\">\n\nThe machine did not \"paint\" the picture out of the blue, it's an iterative learning process. In short, it starts with a blank (noisy) canvas and tries to learn prominent features in both content-image and style-image(s) and present them on the final product. That learning process is mathematically expressed as optimization process of a function representing the combined *similarity* between the output and the inputs. Optimizing i.e. minimizing such function requires algorithm which goes through series of iteration. These iterations are *arguably* the process of (machine) perception. The following gif is a visualization of that process.\n\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoamle/neural-style-example/master/exeter_afremov2.gif\" width=\"460\">\n\n## More images\nPedals + Leonid Afremov's\n<br/>\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoamle/neural-style-example/master/content-imgs/pedals.jpg\" height=\"150\"> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoamle/neural-style-example/master/style-imgs/Afremov4.jpg\" height=\"150\">\n<br/>\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoamle/neural-style-example/master/visually-appealing/pedals-afremov4.png\" width=\"460\">\n\nNear the quay + Van Gogh's Starry Night \n<br/>\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoamle/neural-style-example/master/content-imgs/exe_quay.jpg\" height=\"150\"> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoamle/neural-style-example/master/style-imgs/starry_night.jpg\" height=\"150\">\n<br/>\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoamle/neural-style-example/master/visually-appealing/exe_quay-starrynight.png\" width=\"495\">\n\nLondon + Van Gogh's Starry Night\n<br/> \n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoamle/neural-style-example/master/content-imgs/london.jpg\" height=\"150\"> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoamle/neural-style-example/master/style-imgs/starry_night.jpg\" height=\"150\"> \n<br/>\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoamle/neural-style-example/master/visually-appealing/london-starry.png\" width=\"495\">\n\nField + Van Gogh's Wheat Field with Crows\n<br/> \n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoamle/neural-style-example/master/content-imgs/camb.jpg\" height=\"150\"> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoamle/neural-style-example/master/style-imgs/vangogh_Wheat_Field_with_Crows.jpg\" height=\"150\"> \n<br/>\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoamle/neural-style-example/master/visually-appealing/camb-vangogh_wheatfield.png\" width=\"575\">\n\nPainting study + [creativemints.at.behance](https://www.behance.net/creativemints)'s\n<br/>\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoamle/neural-style-example/master/content-imgs/potr.jpg\" height=\"150\"> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoamle/neural-style-example/master/style-imgs/lostquilt_at_pinterest.jpg\" height=\"150\">\n<br/>\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoamle/neural-style-example/master/visually-appealing/potr-lostquilt.png\" width=\"410\">\n\nPainting study + Picasso's Self-portrait\n<br/>\n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoamle/neural-style-example/master/content-imgs/figure.jpg\" height=\"300\"> <img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoamle/neural-style-example/master/style-imgs/picasso_selfport1907.jpg\" height=\"300\"> => \n<img src=\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hoamle/neural-style-example/master/visually-appealing/figure-picasso_selfportr.png\" height=\"400\">\n\n## Observation\n* **Size matters**. The higher the output image resolution, the more details in the content-image can be explicitly expressed by the indicated style. However, memory is *big* trade-off. Default output image size (512px) on an NIN took as small as 5-600MB, but a 784px image devours 3 times as much! \n* For visual appeal, (i) an **expressive** style and/or (ii) **resemblance** between content-style image pair is the key. \"Expressive\" here is not only about abstract or surreal in specific, but about texture i.e. discernible patterns in colors, strokes, blobs in general. Example work: *Leonid Afremov's painting, The Scream, Monet's water lilies, ...* Eventually, using style-images referenced from complicated realism pieces by the old masters, like Jean Leon Gerome, usually  yields unsatisfiying output with default parameters. Secondly, although it's not always the case, but a landscape picture pairs pretty well with Starry Night or Wheat Field and the Crows; a portrait and Picasso's self-portrait also makes a nice combination. \n* I lust over a Titan X.\n\n## Hardware setup\nOn the technical bit, the main work-horse is a humble nVidia GTX 660 2GB on a dated LGA 775 desktop. GPU(s) with generous memory is desirable. I also used NIN instead of VGG net due to limited VRAM. Each image was generated in ~90 seconds (max. 512px-wide) or 2-3 mins (max. 784px-wide). \n\nIt's *much* faster to run on a GPU instead of CPU. Even a modern i7 K-series can take upto hour to train and generate 1 image of above sizes. However, running on CPU can take advantages of *abundant* host memory (easily >8GB on a single machine), not to mention the possibility to be accompanied with a coprocessor (eg: Xeon Phi), or running on distributed platform.\n\n## References\n1.
