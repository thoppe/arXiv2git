  "README.md": "# memnn_demo\n\nA theano-based project to reproduce facebook's memory network.\n\nSo far, I only managed to implement the basic memory network with two supporting facts and no time feature in consider. Runing on the bAbI datasets (https://research.facebook.com/researchers/1543934539189348) only gave a F1 score around 0.6. \n\nI am hoping take the write time into account would give a siginicant improvement towards the 100% accuracy as shown in facebook's paper. \n\nREFERENCES\n> Weston J, Bordes A, Chopra S, et al.
