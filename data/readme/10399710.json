Assume that :math:`F = G/H` for some functions :math:`G` and :math:`H` holomorphic in a neighborhood of the origin.\nAssume also that :math:`H` is a polynomial.\n\nThis Python 2.7 module for use within `Sage <http://www.sagemath.org>`_ computes asymptotics for the coefficients :math:`F_{r \\alpha}` as :math:`r \\to \\infty` with :math:`r \\alpha \\in \\NN^d` for :math:`\\alpha` in a permissible subset of :math:`d`-tuples of positive reals.\nMore specifically, it computes arbitrary terms of the asymptotic expansion for :math:`F_{r \\alpha}` when the asymptotics are controlled by a strictly minimal multiple point of the alegbraic variety :math:`H = 0`.\n\nThe algorithms and formulas implemented here come from [RaWi2008a]_\nand [RaWi2012]_.\n\n``amgf-0.8.py`` has also been submitted to the Sage Trac server as ``trac_10519-v7.patch`` on `ticket 10519 <http://trac.sagemath.org/sage_trac/ticket/10519>`_ for incorporation into the Sage code base.\nYou are welcome to review the patch. \n\nMain Files\n--------------\n- amgf-0.8.py, Python source file (version date 8 October 2012)\n- amgf-0.8_examples.sws, Sage worksheet of examples\n- docs/amgf-0.8.pdf, documentation\n- trac_10519-v7.patch, Sage patch\n\nInstallation\n-------------\nYou can install the code as a Sage patch file, a process that's a bit technical and described `here <http://ask.sagemath.org/question/1276/how-to-install-patches-or-should-we>`_.\nAlternatively, you can import amgf-0.8.py as a module in a Sage notebook session as follows.\n\n#. Download and install the latest version of Sage from `here <http://sagemath.org>`_.\n#. Download amgf-0.8.py, amgf-0.8_examples, and amgf-0.8.pdf.\n#. Run Sage and open a Sage notebook window. (Type 'notebook()' if you are running Sage from the command line.)\n#. Upload amgf-0.8_examples.sws into your Sage notebook.\n#. Open the worksheet, customize the first cell to point to the location of your copy of amgf-0.8.py, and modify the examples to your liking.\n\n\n.. [RaWi2008a] Alexander Raichev and Mark C.
