FPplus features:\n\n- Header-only library for error-free transforms and double-double computations\n  - Implements error-free addition, multiplication, and fused multiply-add\n  - Implements double-double addition and multiplication in multiple variants\n- Compatible with C99, C++, OpenCL, and CUDA\n- Special versions of error-free transforms in SIMD intrinsics:\n  - x86 SIMD (128-bit and 256-bit AVX + FMA, 512-bit wide MIC and AVX-512)\n  - IBM VSX (POWER 7 and POWER 8) and QPX (Blue Gene/Q)\n  - ARMv8 SIMD\n- Extensive documentation with references to scientific literature\n- Testsuite based on [MPFR](http://www.mpfr.org/) and [Google Test](https://github.com/google/googletest)\n- Examples and code-generators for high-precision algorithms:\n  - Polynomial evaluation with compensated Horner scheme\n  - Compensated dot product algorithm\n  - Inner kernel of matrix multiplication (GEMM) operation in double-double precision\n\n## Requirements\n\n##### CPU targets:\n- gcc-compatible compiler (tested on gcc, clang and icc)\n- Hardware FMA support\n- Precise floating-point semantics\n  - No `-ffast-math` option when compiling with `gcc` or `clang`\n  - `-fp-model precise` when compiling with `icc`\n\n##### OpenCL targets:\n- `cl_khr_fp64`, `cl_amd_fp64`, or `cl_APPLE_fp64_basic_ops` extension\n- Hardware FMA support (`FP_FAST_FMA` must be defined by OpenCL compiler)\n- Precise floating-point semantics\n  - No `-cl-fast-relaxed-math` option\n\n##### CUDA targets:\n- Compute capability 2.0 or higher\n\n## Using FPplus\n\n```c\n#include <fpplus.h>\n```\n\n## Publications\n\nMarat Dukhan, Richard Vuduc and Jason Riedy [\"Wanted: Floating-Point Add Round-off Error instruction\"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00491). arXiv preprint 1603.00491 (2016)\n\nAcknowledgements\n----------------\n\n[![HPC Garage logo](https://github.com/Maratyszcza/PeachPy/blob/master/logo/hpcgarage.png)](http://hpcgarage.org)\n[![Georgia Tech College of Computing logo](https://github.com/Maratyszcza/PeachPy/blob/master/logo/college-of-computing.gif)](http://www.cse.gatech.edu/)\n\nThe library was developed by [Marat Dukhan](http://www.maratdukhan.com) as a research project at [Richard Vuduc](http://vuduc.org)'s HPC Garage lab in the Georgia Institute of Technology, College of Computing, School of Computational Science and Engineering. FPplus is based on algorithms in [Handbook of Floating-Point Arithmetics](https://www.springer.com/us/book/9780817647049), [David Bailey](http://davidhbailey.com/)'s QD library, the works of [Jonathan Shewchuk](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~jrs/papers/robustr.pdf), [Theodorus Dekker](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2717032), [Donald Knuth](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=270146), and [Sylvie Boldo and Jean-Michel Muller](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/LIP/Pub/Rapports/RR/RR2004/RR2004-41.pdf).
