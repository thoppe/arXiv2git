Input data\n\n   To run inference you need 4 files: {train,test,validation,test_users}.tsv in tab-separated format.\n   See the movielens files in example/\n\n   (Additional files are generated from these basic files during evaluation. More on this later.)\n\n2. Running the command\n\n   You can run \"hgaprec\" directly or using the scripts/run.pl Perl script.\n\n   Since hgaprec has numerous options, the perl script is recommended.\n\n   To setup the Perl script, do the following:\n\n   a. Set the \"$dataloc\" variable to the location of the data set directory. For example, for the movielens data, \n   $dataloc = \"/n/fs/example/movielens\";\n\n   b. Set the location of the installed hgaprec binary. For example,\n   $gapbin = \"/n/fs/bin/hgaprec\";\n\n   c. Run the script in one of the following ways:\n\n   (fit the hierarchical model, i.e., HPF)\n   <path-to>/scripts/run.pl -dataset movielens -hier \n\n   (fit HPF to data treated as binary)\n   <path-to>/scripts/run.pl -dataset movielens -hier -binary\n\n   (fit the non-hierarchical model, i.e., BPF to data and treat data as binary)\n   <path-to>/scripts/run.pl -dataset movielens -binary\n\n   (fit the non-hierarchical model with user, item bias terms, i.e., BPF+bias to data)\n   <path-to>/scripts/run.pl -dataset movielens -bias\n\n   (fit the non-hierarchical model with user, item bias terms, i.e., BPF+bias to data treated as binary)\n   <path-to>/scripts/run.pl -dataset movielens -bias -binary\n\n\n  d. Additional options to the Perl script\n\n  -K <integer>: set the latent dimensions K\n  -label <string>: set a label for the output directory\n  -seed <integer>: set the pseudo-random number generator seed \n  -logl: compute ELBO every X iterations (expensive!)\n",
