  "README.md": "# PPHPC: a standard model for research in agent-based modeling and simulation\n\n#### What does PPHPC mean?\n\nPredator-Prey for High-Performance Computing\n\n#### What is the purpose of this model?\n\nThe purpose of PPHPC is to serve as a standard model for studying and evaluating \nspatial agent-based model (SABM) implementation strategies. It is a realization \nof a predator-prey dynamic system, and captures important characteristics of \nSABMs, such as agent movement and local agent interactions. The model can be \nimplemented using substantially different approaches that ensure statistically \nequivalent qualitative results. Implementations may differ in aspects such as \nthe selected system architecture, choice of programming language and/or \nagent-based modeling framework, parallelization strategy, random number \ngenerator, and so forth. By comparing distinct PPHPC implementations, valuable \ninsights can be obtained on the computational and algorithmical design of SABMs\nin general.\n\n#### Currently available implementations\n\n* [Netlogo](https://github.com/FakenMC/pphpc/tree/netlogo/netlogo)\n([certified OpenABM implementation](https://www.openabm.org/model/4693/))\n* [Java (parallel)](https://github.com/FakenMC/pphpc/tree/java/java)\n* [OpenCL (GPU+CPU)](https://github.com/FakenMC/pphpc/tree/opencl/opencl) \n(in progress)\n\n#### Publications\n\n* Fachada, N., Lopes, V.V., Martins, R.C., Rosa, A.C.,\nTowards a standard model for research in agent-based modeling and simulation, \n[PeerJ Computer Science](https://peerj.com/computer-science/), \n2015, http://dx.doi.org/10.7717/peerj-cs.36\n\n* Fachada, N., Lopes, V.V., Martins, R.C., Rosa, A.C., \nParallelization strategies for spatial agent-based models,\n[International Journal of Parallel Programming](http://www.springer.com/computer/theoretical+computer+science/journal/10766), \n2016, http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10766-015-0399-9\n([arXiv preprint](http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04047))\n\n* Fachada, N., Lopes, V.V., Martins, R.C., Rosa, A.C., \nModel-independent comparison of simulation output, under review, 2015 \n([arXiv preprint](http://arxiv.org/abs/1509.09174))\n\n#### Licenses\n\nSeveral Open Source licenses, which depend on the implementation.\n\n",
