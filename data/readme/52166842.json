It is shown in video at https://youtu.be/KGUrMSvD4RI\n- The agent is learning and recognizing a vocabulary of 1200 words. It is shown in video at https://youtu.be/kjhJ7Q-7Ys0\n- The agent has learned and recognized the first 375 of the 1200 words then it has run out of 16 Gb memory :(\n\nI am looking for a definition of a mathematical machine for learning. \nThe Mental Processing Unit (MPU) is a computational mental organ introduced \nin detail in the manuscript called \"Samu in His Prenatal Development\". This \nis a possible definition that is based on the Samu's COP-based Q-learning \n(see http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02889) and on the well-known basic processes \nin infant development called habituation and sensitization. I have performed \nseveral experiments for creating the definition of MPUs. The SamuVocal in \nquestion is a strong simplification of the SamuBrain \n(see https://github.com/nbatfai/SamuBrain) because the MPU of SamuVocal uses \nonly a vector of Samu's COP-based Q-learning instead of a matrix.\n\n## Usage\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/nbatfai/SamuVocab.git\ncd SamuBrain/\n~/Qt/5.5/gcc_64/bin/qmake SamuLife.pro\nmake\n./SamuVocab 2>out\n```\n\n```\ntail -f out|grep \"HIGHER-ORDER NOTION MONITOR\"\n```\n\n```\ntail -f out|grep SENSITIZATION\n```\n\n```\ntail -f out|grep \"HABITUATION MONITOR\" \n```\n\n```\ntail -f out|grep \"WORD\" \n```\n\n## Experiments with this project\n\n### Samu (Nahshon) has learned a vocabulary of 20 words\n\nSamu has learned the words of the paper 'Baby's First 10 Words' (see Table 4 in http://waldron.stanford.edu/~babylab/pdfs/Tardifetal2008.pdf)\nThis version is tagged by 'v20words'.
