The game\nruns in computer system's terminals. Mainly, it was developed for UNIX-type\nsystems but it works pretty well in nearly all the operating systems because of\ncross-platform compatibility of the programming language used.\n\nThe game uses language's concurrency primitives to simplify most of the hefty\nparts of the game. A *real-time notification delivery* architecture is developed\nusing language's built-in concurrency support, which performs similar to event\nbased *context aware invocations* like we see on the web platform\n\n> Customized version of the template [zhiyuanshi/pl-latex-templates](https://github.com/zhiyuanshi/pl-latex-templates)\n\n",
