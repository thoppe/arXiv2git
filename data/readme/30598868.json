(See arxiv:1209.2124 for more details.) This script\npresents the \"riq index\", taken to be 1000 times the riq, based on the data\navailable on inspirehep.net. Thus, it is intended for people in high energy\nphysics and related fields.\n\nNote that in computing the tori, self-citations are removed only in the cases\nthat the author for whom we are computing the riq index is an author of the\nciting article. I.e. if paper A by X and Y is cited by paper B by Y alone, we do\nnot consider paper B a self-cite when computing the tori of X. (However, it\nwould be excluded for the tori of Y.)\n\nThe main speed limitation is the way in which bibliography lengths must be\ndetermined. On InspireHep, there is (as far as I know) no way to query the\nnumber of references of a record directly. This script works by obtaining the\nMARCXML of *every* citing article, then counting the number of bibliography\nentries. An alternate strategy might be to download the XHTML output and parsing\nout the number cached by InspireHep. (I'll see how much faster it is and update\nif it's worth it.)\n\n\n",
