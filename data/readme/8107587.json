All example programs run two tests in sequence: solve a\nlinear system `Ax = b` with `A` the identiy matrix, and solve a linear\nsystem where `A` is a random matrix with coefficients drawn uniformly\nfrom an interval.\n\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n* The original [draft paper by Raghavendra][1] describing the new\n  solver for linear systems on finite fields:\n  <http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~prasad/linsystems.pdf>\n\n* [R.
