  "README.md": "# Overview\n\nThis is a collection of programs to analyze Mark Wise and Yue Zhang's\nwork on modeling dark matter as a Dirac fermion that's Yukawa-coupled to\na scalar field.\n\nThe original paper, linked in the CWEB, is at\n[arXiv:1411.1772](http://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1772). **This program needs\nCWEB, pdftex, and a C++ compiler!** You can set the variables in the\nMakefile to your preferences, I use pdftex and the GNU C++ compiler\n(because that's all I got).\n\nThis is written in CWEB, so it is its own documentation. To compile the\nmanual, simply type `make doc` in the console. To compile the program to\nrun, `make bin` will compile the code. If you type `make` or `make all`,\nit will compile the executable *and* produce the documentation.\n\n**NOTE:** This work *extends* Zhang and Wise's work, in that we can\nconsider a scalar field with a nonzero mass.\n\n# Algorithm\n\nThe basic algorithm can easily be generalized to ODEs with Neumann\nboundary conditions. I actually haven't seen this approach taken\nanywhere, and can be used for any elliptic problem with spherical\nsymmetry. Basically, if you have a problem which can be put in the form\n`f'(x) = \\int^{x}_{0}G(r,f(r))dr`, with `f'(0)=0`, you can use this\ntrick: `f'(x) = f'(x-h) + \\int^{x}_{x-h}G(r,f(r))dr`. The numerical\nroutine takes advantage of this identity, which apparently Mathematica\ncannot do.\n\n# License\n\nEverything is under the MIT License, as noted in the LICENSE file and\nthe \"License\" section of the software.\n",
