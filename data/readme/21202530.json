  "README.md": "IPCA\n====\n\nThis package implements Ideal PCA in MATLAB. \n\nIdeal PCA is a cross-kernel based feature extraction algorithm which is (a) a faster alternative to kernel PCA and (b) a method to learn data manifold certifying features.\n\nFor a derivation of the algorithm and details, see\n\nFranz J. Kiraly, Martin Kreuzer, Louis Theran. *Learning with Cross-Kernels and IPCA*. http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2646\n\n\nGetting started\n---------------\n\nCopy all files to a directory in your MATLAB path.\n\nThe release contains a template script example_script.m which needs to be completed before running. See the file for further explanation.\n\nThe IPCA algorithm is encapsulated in two routines:\n\nIPCA pre-computes the cross-kernel matrices and other parameters;\n\nIPCA_eval takes the output of IPCA and converts it into a collection of output features which can be specified by the user, depending on the learning task.\n\nSee the inline documentation in IPCA.m and IPCA_eval.m for usage syntax.\n\n\nLicense\n-------\n\nCopyright (c) 2014, Franz J.
