See http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013AJ....145...52M\n\nam_getmetal_late only works on K band spectra, and is designed to work on M4.5-M9.5 dwarf stars. See http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1403.5560\n\nRead the comets in each program for a better understanding of syntax, program restrictions, etc. Don't forget to put your spectra in the star's rest frame.\n\nYou might also need the RV code, which is now on gitub: https://github.com/awmann/RV_code\n",
