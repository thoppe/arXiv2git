They share a common github repository just because (2) is an evolution of (1). \n\nSee the README files on each directory for specific instructions on compiling/using this code.\n\n\nPlease, if you make use of any of this projects, we appreciate it if you cite the respective paper(s):\n\n\n```\n@inproceedings{GomezDAS2016,\n  author    = {Lluis Gomez and Dimosthenis Karatzas},\n  title     = {A fine-grained approach to scene text script identification},\n  booktitle = {DAS},\n  year      = {2016},\n}\n```\n\n```\n@article{GomezARXIV2016,\n  author    = {Lluis Gomez, Anguelos Nicolaou, Dimosthenis Karatzas},\n  title     = {Boosting patch-based scene text script identification with ensembles of conjoined networks},\n  journal   = {ArXiv},\n  year      = {2016},\n}\n```\n",
