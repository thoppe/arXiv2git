Data is harvested in chunks.\n\n```sh\n$ metha-sync http://export.arxiv.org/oai2\n...\n```\n\nAll downloaded files are written to\n\n```sh\n$ METHA_DIR=/tmp/harvest metha-sync -dir http://export.arxiv.org/oai2\n/tmp/harvest/I29haV9kYyNodHRwOi8vZXhwb3J0LmFyeGl2Lm9yZy9vYWky\n```\n\nThe default `METHA_DIR` is `$HOME/.metha`.\n\nHarvesting can be CTRL-C'd any time. The data is harvested up to the last full\nday, so there is a small latency. The HTTP client is resilient.\n\nExample: If the current date would be *Thu Apr 21 14:28:10 CEST 2016*, the harvester\nwould request all data since the repositories earliest date and *2016-04-20 23:59:59*.\n\nYou can stream records to stdout, too.\n\n```sh\n$ metha-cat http://export.arxiv.org/oai2\n```\n\nThis will stream all harvested records to stdout. You can emit records based on datestamp as well:\n\n```sh\n$ metha-cat -from 2016-01-01 http://export.arxiv.org/oai2\n```\n\nThis will only stream records with a datestamp equal or after 2016-01-01.\n\nTo just stream all data really fast, use find and zcat on the harvesting dir.\n\nTo display basic repository information:\n\n```sh\n$ metha-id http://export.arxiv.org/oai2\n```\n\nTo list all harvested endpoints:\n\n```sh\n$ metha-ls\n```\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nUse a [release](https://github.com/miku/metha/releases) or\n\n```sh\n$ go get github.com/miku/metha/cmd/...\n```\n\nHarvesting Roulette\n-------------------\n\n```sh\n$ metha-sync $(sort -R contrib/sites.tsv | head -1)\n```\n\nErrors this harvester can somewhat handle\n-----------------------------------------\n\n* responses with resumption tokens that lead to empty responses\n* gzipped responses, that are not advertised as such\n* funny (illegal) control characters in XML responses\n* repositories, that won't respond unless the dates are given with the exact granualarity\n* repositories with endless token loops\n* repositories that do not support selective harvesting (use `metha-sync -no-intervals URL`)\n* limited repositories, metha will try up to 8 times with an exponential backoff\n",
