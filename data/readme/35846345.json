Furthermore, it\ncomes with an extensive library of known triangulations of manifolds and\nprovides the user with the possibility to create own complex libraries.\nsimpcomp caches computed properties of a simplicial complex, thus avoiding\nunnecessary computations, internally handles the vertex labeling of the\ncomplexes and insures the consistency of a simplicial complex throughout all\noperations.\nsimpcomp relies on the GAP package homology for its homology computation, but\nalso provides the user with an own (co-)homology algorithm in case the packacke\nhomology is not available.

See the\n  function prefix SCsFromGroup.\n- Expanded the library to also contain pseudomanifolds -- the library now\n  contains ca. 650 manifolds and ca. 7000 pseudomanifolds, it indexes the\n  properties IsManifold and IsPM and supports them in property-based searches.\n- SCExportLatexTable now uses SCFacets instead of SCFacetsEx and thus respects\n  vertex labelings. Take care not to choose to wild labels though, these are not\n  checked for latex compatibility during the export.\n- Changed naming scheme of automorphism groups -- StructureDescription is only\n  called if the group cannot be found in GAPs group libraries out of speed\n  considerations.\n- Fixed small error in SCIntFunc.ReadPermGroup resulting in an error when trying\n  to load complexes with trivial automorphism groups\n\n30/04/2010 - Version 1.2.73: Midsize update. simpcomp now has a mascot!\n- Added support for polyhedral Morse functions, prefix: SCMorse...,\n  including a (naive) test for tightness of a triangulation (SCIsTight).\n- Minor updates of the complex library.\n\n07/04/2010 - Version 1.1.43\n- IMPORTANT FIX: fixed incorrect calculation of g-vectors (last entry was\n  missing) and updated library accordingly\n- Added SCDehnSommervilleCheck and SCDehnSommervilleMatrix\n- Added SCFVectorBdCyclicPolytope and SCBdCyclicPolytope\n- Removed cyclic polytopes from library (see above)\n- Added SCIsFlag to check whether a complex is flag\n- Added SCRandomize to support randomizing of complexes via bistellar moves\n- Again modified f-vector routine; should be faster now\n- SCFromGenerators now saves the automorphism group to the complex\n- Fixed small error in SCSortComplex\n\n14/01/2010 - Version 1.1.21\n- Improved performance of f-vector calculation (does not need face lattice\n  any more)\n\n26/11/2009 - Version 1.1.9\n- Fixed loading errors of package when package `homology' is not loaded\n- Added support for normal surfaces, along with additional documentation\n- Complexes in library updated\n\n16/11/2009 - Version 1.0.440\n- Updated file and directory attributes to comply with GAP standard.\n- Added function SCIntersectionFormSignature. Thanks to Michael Eisermann for\n  helpful comments on calculating signatures of matrices without the need of\n  calculating eigenvalues.\n\n11/11/2009 - Version 1.0.435\n- Updated Documentation \n- Updated GRAPE availability test to reliably work with GRAPE 4.3\n\n26/10/2009 - Version 1.0.403\n- Minor compatibility fixes in this release\n- Fixed some error messages on undefined global variables during loading of \t\t\n  simpcomp when the packages `homology' and/or `GRAPE' are not present\n- Fallback to functions of `homology' package are now handled correctly\n- Added extended testing functionality and SCRunTest\n\n13/10/2009 - Version 1.0.389 \n- Initial version\n\n\nRoadmap\n=======\n\nThe following features are planned to be supported in future versions of\nsimpcomp:\n\n * Better simplification strategies\n * Coverings (finite index subgroups)\n * Presentation two-complex (from fp-group)\n  \n\t\t\nBugs\n====\n\nWe have thorougly tested simpcomp on errors.

Got rid of testshort.gap and testall.gap, the\n  only function you need from now on is SCRunTest().\n- Added interface to GAP package \"homalg\" by Mohamed Barakat -- the\n  package can now be used for homology-related computations. In particular,\n  simpcomp can now calculate homology groups with arbitrary coefficients\n  using homalg.\n\n17/08/2010 - Version 1.3.3: Minor bug-fix\n- Adjusted test files to accommodate some changes made in the\n  versions 1.3.1 and 1.3.2\n\n12/08/2010 - Version 1.3.2: Minor bug-fix\n- Fixed dependencies on other packages\n\n05/08/2010 - Version 1.3.1: Minor bug-fix\n- Fixed minor issues with undeclared local variables\n- Fixed wrong output format of SCAutomorphismGroupInternal\n\n26/05/2010 - Version 1.3.0: Major update. \n             New functions, updated library and bug fixes.\n- simpcomp has learned to generate all triangulations with k-transitive\n  automorphism groups given a prescribed dimension and vertex number. See the\n  function prefix SCsFromGroup.\n- Expanded the library to also contain pseudomanifolds -- the library now\n  contains ca. 650 manifolds and ca. 7000 pseudomanifolds, it indexes the\n  properties IsManifold and IsPM and supports them in property-based searches.\n- SCExportLatexTable now uses SCFacets instead of SCFacetsEx and thus respects\n  vertex labelings. Take care not to choose to wild labels though, these are not\n  checked for latex compatibility during the export.\n- Changed naming scheme of automorphism groups -- StructureDescription is only\n  called if the group cannot be found in GAPs group libraries out of speed\n  considerations.\n- Fixed small error in SCIntFunc.ReadPermGroup resulting in an error when trying\n  to load complexes with trivial automorphism groups\n\n30/04/2010 - Version 1.2.73: Midsize update. simpcomp now has a mascot!\n- Added support for polyhedral Morse functions, prefix: SCMorse...,\n  including a (naive) test for tightness of a triangulation (SCIsTight).\n- Minor updates of the complex library.\n\n07/04/2010 - Version 1.1.43\n- IMPORTANT FIX: fixed incorrect calculation of g-vectors (last entry was\n  missing) and updated library accordingly\n- Added SCDehnSommervilleCheck and SCDehnSommervilleMatrix\n- Added SCFVectorBdCyclicPolytope and SCBdCyclicPolytope\n- Removed cyclic polytopes from library (see above)\n- Added SCIsFlag to check whether a complex is flag\n- Added SCRandomize to support randomizing of complexes via bistellar moves\n- Again modified f-vector routine; should be faster now\n- SCFromGenerators now saves the automorphism group to the complex\n- Fixed small error in SCSortComplex\n\n14/01/2010 - Version 1.1.21\n- Improved performance of f-vector calculation (does not need face lattice\n  any more)\n\n26/11/2009 - Version 1.1.9\n- Fixed loading errors of package when package `homology' is not loaded\n- Added support for normal surfaces, along with additional documentation\n- Complexes in library updated\n\n16/11/2009 - Version 1.0.440\n- Updated file and directory attributes to comply with GAP standard.\n- Added function SCIntersectionFormSignature. Thanks to Michael Eisermann for\n  helpful comments on calculating signatures of matrices without the need of\n  calculating eigenvalues.\n\n11/11/2009 - Version 1.0.435\n- Updated Documentation \n- Updated GRAPE availability test to reliably work with GRAPE 4.3\n\n26/10/2009 - Version 1.0.403\n- Minor compatibility fixes in this release\n- Fixed some error messages on undefined global variables during loading of \t\t\n  simpcomp when the packages `homology' and/or `GRAPE' are not present\n- Fallback to functions of `homology' package are now handled correctly\n- Added extended testing functionality and SCRunTest\n\n13/10/2009 - Version 1.0.389 \n- Initial version\n\n\nRoadmap\n=======\n\nThe following features are planned to be supported in future versions of\nsimpcomp:\n\n * Better simplification strategies\n * Coverings (finite index subgroups)\n * Presentation two-complex (from fp-group)\n\n\t\t\nBugs\n====\n\nWe have thorougly tested simpcomp on errors.
