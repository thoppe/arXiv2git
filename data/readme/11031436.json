Two variants are available:\n\n*   Variational Bayesian logistic regression with Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD).\n\n    In this case, the prior on the weight vector is a zero-mean multivariance Gaussian with a diagonal matrix in which each diagonal element is modeled separately by an inverse-Gamma hyper-prior.\n\n*   Variational Bayesian logistic regression without ARD.\n   \n    The model is the same as for the ARD variant, only that all the elements of the diagonal covariance matrix are modeled in combination by the same inverse-Gamma hyper-prior.\n\nThe code is licensed under the New BSD License.\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nFind more information about derivation and use in *Variational Bayesian\ninference for linear and logistic regression*, [arxiv:1310.5438](http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.5438) [stat.ML]\n\n",
