The first column\n                should be the multipole order l, and the rest should\n                correspond to as many power spectra as there are pairs\n                of input maps. E.g. if pol=1 and pol_2=1, the columns\n                should be, in this order:\n                  l  clEE  clEB  clBE  clBB\n                These Cl are the pseudo-Cl of the noise for each\n                component.\n  - coupling -> path to file containing coupling matrix (optional)\n                If non-existing, it will be computed and\n                written there. Set to \"none\" if you don't want to save\n                the coupling matrix (default).\n  - out      -> output prefix\n  - nlb      -> number of ells per bin\n  - h        -> this help\n",
