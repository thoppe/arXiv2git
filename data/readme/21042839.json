Download latest released\n   [SpinorsExtrasWithDependencies.zip](https://github.com/jkuczm/SpinorsExtras/releases/download/v1.0.2/SpinorsExtrasWithDependencies.zip)\n   file.\n   \n    Note that S@M package is **not** included in the zip file, you need to\n    install it separately.\n\n2. Extract downloaded `SpinorsExtrasWithDependencies.zip` to any directory\n   which is on Mathematica `$Path`, e.g. to one obtained by evaluating\n   `FileNameJoin[{$UserBaseDirectory,\"Applications\"}]`.\n\n3. To load the package evaluate: ``Needs[\"SpinorsExtras`\"]``.\n\n\n\n## Upgrading\n\nTo upgrade SpinorsExtras package to the latest released version, evaluate code\ngiven in [Automatic installation](#automatic-installation) section.\nIt will uninstall package and its dependencies and install newest versions.\n\n\n\n## Uninstall\n\nTo uninstall SpinorsExtras package and its dependencies remove\n`SpinorsExtras`,\n`EvaluationUtilities`,\n`MessagesUtilities`,\n`OptionsUtilities`,\n`PatternUtilities`,\n`ProtectionUtilities`,\n`StringUtilities`,\n`MUnitExtras`\ndirectories from installation directory.\n\nIf you used [automatic installation](#automatic-installation), path to\ninstallation directory can be obtained by evaluating\n`FileNameJoin[{$UserBaseDirectory,\"Applications\"}]` in Mathematica.\n\n\n\n## Documentation\n\nSpinors Extras package comes with documentation integrated with Mathematica\nDocumentation Center. To use it, open the documentation center\n(`Help` > `Documentation Center`) and type \"SpinorsExtras\" in the search field.\n\nDocumentation for any individual symbol from Spinors Extras package, can be\nalso called by selecting this symbols name in Mathematica and pressing the F1\nkey.\n\n[Online version of documentation](http://www.fuw.edu.pl/~jkuczm/SpinorsExtras/reference/guide/SpinorsExtras.html)\nis available on project website.\n\n[Publication introducing package](http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.5612) is available\non arXiv.\n\n\n\n## Tests\n\nSpinors Extras package is distributed with an extensive automated test suite\nconsisting of more than four thousand tests. To run the tests one needs\nMUnit package that is distributed with\n[Mathematica version 10](http://www.wolfram.com/mathematica/new-in-10/integrated-unit-testing/)\nand with\n[Wolfram Workbench](http://reference.wolfram.com/workbench/index.jsp?topic=/com.wolfram.eclipse.help/html/tasks/tester/tester.html).\n\nTo run tests in Mathematica version 10 evaluate:\n```Mathematica\nNeeds[\"MUnit`\"]\n\nTestRun[\"SpinorsExtras/Tests/suite.mt\"]\n```\n\n\n\n## Compatibility\n\nEach release of Spinors Extras package is tested with Mathematica versions\n8.0, 9.0 and 10.0.\n\n\n\n## Bugs and requests\n\nBug reports and feature requests can be posted as\n[GitHub issues](https://github.com/jkuczm/SpinorsExtras/issues)\n(the preferred way) or sent directly to\n[author's email](mailto:Jakub.Kuczmarski@fuw.edu.pl).\n\n\n\n## Contributing\n\nFeel free to fork and send pull requests.\n\nIf you want to use Ant scripts from this repository you will also need to\ninstall [WWBCommon](https://github.com/jkuczm/WWBCommon) project.\n\nAll contributions are welcome!\n\n\n\n## License\n\nThis package is released under\n[The MIT License](https://github.com/jkuczm/SpinorsExtras/blob/master/LICENSE).\n\n\n\n## Versioning\n\nReleases of this package will be numbered using\n[Semantic Versioning guidelines](http://semver.org/).\n",
