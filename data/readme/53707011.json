  "README.md": "# MountainLab\nMountainLab is a collection of processing, visualization, and validation tools for spike sorting of electrophysiological recordings. It is under development by Jeremy Magland and Alex Barnett at the Simons Center for Data Analysis (SCDA).\n\nThe software suite (in flux) comprises the following:\n\n* MountainSort -- Core C++ library for sorting of multi-electride recordings.\n\n* MountainView -- Collection of Qt/C++ widgets for visualizing generic electrophysiological datasets and sorting results.\n\n* MountainBrowser -- Web-browser based exploration of studies and experiments on a server.\n\n* A Matlab toolset for processing, visualizing, and validating spike sorting data and a set of Matlab wrappers to MountainSort and MountainView.\n\n## Developers\n\n* Jeremy Magland\n* Alex Barnett\n* Sebastian Baginski\n* Witold Wysota\n\n## License\n\nThis is open source software released under the terms of the GPLv3. For alternative licensing options, please contact scdainfo@simonsfoundation.org.\n\n## Installation and Basic Usage\n\nMountainLab has been developed and tested in Linux (Ubuntu and CentOS), but should also run (with some expertise) on any operating sytem that supports Qt/C++ such as Windows or Mac OS X. Much of the Matlab functionality is available without needing to install the C++ programs. C++ programs also run independently (without Matlab) from the command line.\n\nGeneral instructions for all operating systems (see specifics below):\n\n* Install git and clone this repository.\n\n* Install Qt5 and Lapack development libraries.\n\n* Compile MountainSort by running qmake and make from a terminal inside the mountainlab/mountainsort/src directory.\n\n* Compile MountainView by running qmake and make from a terminal inside the mountainlab/mountainview/src directory.\n\n* (Optional) From within Matlab navigate to mountainlab/matlab and run mountainlab_setup.m.\n\nSeveral demo command-line and Matlab scripts are found in /demo and /matlab/demo, respectively.\n\n##Installation on Linux\n\nFollow the above steps using the these hints along the way.\n\n**Installation of git and cloning this repository:**\n```bash\nUbuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install git\nCentOS/Red Hat: sudo yum install git\ngit clone https://github.com/magland/mountainlab.git\n```\n\n**Installation of Qt5:**\n\n[Download Qt5](https://www.qt.io/download-open-source/)\n(Follow the instructions for installing the open source version)\n\n**Installation of Lapack:**\n```bash\nUbuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install libfftw3-dev liblapacke liblapack-dev liblapacke-dev\nCentOS/Red Hat: sudo yum install lapack-devel.x86_64\n```\n\n**Compilation:**\n```bash\n./compile_mountainsort.sh\n./compile_mountainview.sh\n./compile_mountainbrowser.sh\n```\n\n**Opening Matlab:**\n```\n# First buy matlab\nmatlab\n```\n```matlab\ncd mountainlab/matlab\nmountainlab_setup\n```\n\n## Users Guide\n\n[Preliminary version of Users Guide](doc/usersguide.md)\n\n## API Docs\n\n[Preliminary version of API Docs](http://magland.github.io/mountainlab/)\n\n## References\n\n[Barnett, Alex H., Jeremy F.
