The Tensor Train Rank-1 symmetric eigenvalue decomposition (TTr1SED) does the same for a tensor that is symmetric in the last 2 modes of equal dimension. This allows for a very straightforward determination of a low-rank approximation as well as an easy quantification of the approximation error.\n\n1. Functions\n------------\n\n* [U,S,V,sigmas]=ttr1svd(A) or [U,S,V,sigmas]=ttr1sed(A) \n\nUse this function to compute the TTr1SVD(/SED) decomposition.\n\n* Atilde=getAtilde(U,sigmas,V,sigmaI,n)\n\nUse this function to compute a rank-R approximation Atilde of A from the TTr1SVD(/SED) decomposition.\n\n* demo.m\n\nSmall demo that illustrates the use of most functions in this pacakge.\n\n* [S,Q]=ttr12tucker(U,sigmas,V,n)\n\nConverts a tensor A of size n in the TTr1SVD format to the Tucker (HOSVD) format. Usually results in a more sparse core S compared to traditional methods (e.g. Alternating Least Squares).\n\n* O=orthc(A) or O=orthc(A,tol)\n\nThis function computes all outer vector products that form tensors orthogonal to A. \n\n* ocv=verifyOrtc(A,O)\n\nUse this function to verify that all tensors that can be formed with vectors in O are orthogonal to A.\n\n2.
