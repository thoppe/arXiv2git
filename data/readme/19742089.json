  "Readme.txt": "This code implements the local community detection methods used in \n    Jeub, L. G. S., Balachandran, P., Porter, M. A., Mucha, P. J., \n    & Mahoney, M. W. (2014, March 15). \n    Think Locally, Act Locally: The Detection of Small, Medium-Sized, \n    and Large Communities in Large Networks. arXiv:1403.3795 [cs.SI]\n\nThe main interface is the NCP function which computes local and global \nNCPs using the AclCut, MovCut, or EgoNet methods described in the paper. \n\nTo create a conductance ratio profile (CRP), first compute the network \ncommunity profile using the NCP function, storing both the conductance \nvalues and communities. Then compute the internal conductance for \nthese communities using the InternalConductance function. One then \nobtains the conductance ratio profile by dividing the NCP by the \ninternal conductance, e.g.\n\n[conductance,S]=NCP(A,'ACL');\n[internal_conductance]=InternalConductance(A,S);\n\nCRP=conductance./internal_conductance\n\nThis code is licensed under a FreeBSD license (see License.txt), except\nfor lobpcg.m by A.V.
