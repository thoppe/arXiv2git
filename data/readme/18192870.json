It is an elegant solution to the problem posed by contrastive divergence.\n\nThis code uses MPF to train restricted boltzmann machines (RBM) and partially restricted boltzmann machines (with connectivity between hidden units).\n\nOptimization options:\n- SGD       (minibatch stochastic gradient descent with momentum)\n- BFGS \t\t(scipy.optimize)\n- SOF       (https://github.com/Sohl-Dickstein/Sum-of-Functions-Optimizer must be installed).\n\n",
