  "README.md": "Our Local Spacetime\n===================\n\nAuthor: Jonah Miller (jonah.maxwell.miller@gmail.com)\n\nThis is a simplistic python script to generate a plot of the spaceitme\naround Earth using an isometric embedding of the surface\n\nds^2 = -(1 - rs/r) dt^2 + (1-rs/r)^(-1) dr^2\n\ninto 3D Minkowski space. The angular components of the metric are set\nto zero. The plot uses radial coordinates and avoids the coordinate\nsingularity at the schwarzschild radius by stopping at the radius of\nthe surface of the Earth which is outside the Schwarzschild\nradius. Units are arbitrary.\n\nThis code is a companion to the blog article I wrote about our local\nspacetime:\n    \nhttp://www.thephysicsmill.com/2015/09/06/our-local-spacetime/\n\nThe images included in \"figs\" are not produced in Python. They were\nproduced in Maple 16.\n\nRequirements\n------------\n\nPython and the the scientific python stack including numpy, scipy,\nand matplotlib.\n\nThe code should work with either python2 or pyhton3.\n\nRunning\n-------\n\nJust run the script to generate the image:\n\n```python local_spacetime.py```\n\n\nSource\n------\n\nThis code uses the isometric embedding defined by Don Marolf in his\npaper \"Spacetime Embedding Diagrams for Black Holes,\" General\nRelativity and Gravitation 31 (1999) 919-944. A preprint of the work\nis available on the arXiv: http://arxiv.org/abs/gr-qc/9806123\n\n\n",
