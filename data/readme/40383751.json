The algorithms incorporate both continuous-valued as well as discrete-valued perturbations into both our algorithms. The former are chosen to be independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) symmetric uniformly distributed random variables (r.v.), while the latter are i.i.d., asymmetric Bernoulli r.v.s. See [3] for a detailed description.\n\n2 Notes on Usage\n----------------\nThe main files in the distribution are:\n\nFirst-order schemes:\n-------------------\ni) onespsa.m --> this contains the implementation of first-order SPSA algorithm [1] and is a simplified version of that available on J.C. Spall's ISSO book website http://www.jhuapl.edu/ISSO\nii) onerdsa_unif.m --> An RDSA variant of the 1SPSA code from J.C. Spall. The primary difference is in the generation of perturbation r.v.s. In this case, the latter are sampled from an uniform [-1,1] distribution.\niii) onerdsa_asymber.m --> Similar to 1RDSA-Unif, except that the perturbation r.v.s. follow an asymmetric Bernoulli distribution.\n\nSecond-order schemes:\n---------------------\ni) twospsa.m --> this contains the implementation of second-order SPSA algorithm [2] and is a simplified version of that available on J.C. Spall's ISSO book website \nii) twordsa_unif.m --> An RDSA variant of the 2SPSA code from J.C. Spall. The primary difference is in the generation of perturbation r.v.s. In this case, the latter are sampled from an uniform [-1,1] distribution.\niii) twordsa_asymber.m --> Similar to 2RDSA-Unif, except that the perturbation r.v.s. follow an asymmetric Bernoulli distribution.\n\nOn input parameters: Most of the algorithms above take as input the following:\np -> dimension of the problem\nsigma -> noise parameter. Noise is (p+1)-dimensional Gaussian with variance sigma^2\ntype -> 1 for quadratic, 2 for fourth-order loss (see loss_myexample.m)\nnumSimulation -> this is the simulation budget that impacts the number of 2SPSA iterations\nreplications -> number of independent simulations\ntheta_0 -> initial point\n\n4 References\n------------\n[1] J.
