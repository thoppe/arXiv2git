  "README.md": "# streaming_VOP_clustering\n\nThis code generates moving and static object proposals (VOP) in generic video and clusters those proposals in a streaming way described in \"Detecting Temporally Consistent Objects in Videos through Object Class Label Propagation\"\nhttp://arxiv.org/pdf/1601.05447.pdf.\n\nStreaming clustering of VOP can enable object class label propagation for temporally consistent object detection in videos.\nThe code is tested on Ubuntu 14.04\nThe MATLAB script vid_obj.m is the starting file. All the dependencies are already available in the package. The demo runs for videos downloaded from Youtube. The input and output folder are there in \"Data\".\n\nDifferent configuration options can be turned ON or OFF in the options structure in vid_obj: e.g. \n\noptions.segmentation = 1/0 means Enable or Disbale segmentation results generation as a by-product of clustering \n\noptions.debug = 1/0 means Enable or Disbale debugging with all intermediate results\n\noptions.eb_thresh sets the threshold needed for edgeBoxes score (default is 0.25) \n\noptions.auto_cluster = 1/0 means Enable or Disbale automatic number of cluster usage \n\noptions.volume_cluster = 1/0 means Enable or Disbale streaming clustering \n\noptions.volume_frames sets the frame number in a sub-sequence for streaming volume clustering\n\n\n",
