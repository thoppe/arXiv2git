  "README.md": "# INTRODUCTION #\r\n\r\nThis repository contains a folder called Packages, which contains Mathematica packages (.m files) and their correspondent notebooks (.nb files). These notebooks have a command that generates the packages, and they also contain examples and explanations. Let me introduce the packages: <br />\r\n* **geoMetric.m** uses **commons.m** and **algebraDirac.m**. <br />\r\n* **PilchWarner.m** contains the Pilch-Warner geometry and its background fields, from the reference paper: <br />\r\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/hep-th/0306098 <br />\r\n* **Dbrane.m** contains the kappa-symmetry projector. \r\n* **matrixEDC.m** is taken from <br />\r\nhttp://www.inp.demokritos.gr/~sbonano/EDC/ <br />\r\nOnly it's wedge products and exterior derivatives are used. <br />\r\n\r\nThe files in the main folder use the packages above. They are: <br />\r\n* **SupergravityPW.nb**, that checks the supergravity equations for the Pilch Warner background. <br />\r\n* **SusyPW.nb**, that computes the dilatino's and gravitino's variational equation for Pilch Warner geometry.\r\n* **D3branePW.nb**, which contains computations for the paper <br />\r\nhttp://arxiv.org/pdf/1512.06420v1.pdf <br />\r\n(Note that there are small typos in the paper that will be fixed soon. The PilchWarner package is so far correct.)\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n# HOW TO USE THE PACKAGES #\r\n\r\nLoad the packages by adding its directory to $PATH and then, use Get (<<).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
