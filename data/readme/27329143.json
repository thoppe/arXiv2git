  "README.md": "REASON2\n=======\n\nMatlab codes for REASON2, paper can be found at http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.5131\n\n\nThis repository provides Matlab codes for running REASON 2. This paper will be presented in NIPS 2014 http://nips.cc/Conferences/2014/Program/event.php?ID=4676\nThe long version can be accessed at\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1402.5131\n\nThe code uses the PROPACK package (and choosvd.m)  from IALM to make a fair comparison with IALM. To access the package use the following link\nhttp://perception.csl.illinois.edu/matrix-rank/sample_code.html\nand download IALM codes.\n\nOur code consists of two files\n1.prepare.m \nyou make the matrix M here. \n2.REASON2.m \nThis file accesses the sample matrix, runs REASON2 and shows individual reconstruction errors at every iteration of the REASON2. The code can be used to run the algorithm for a specific time span or for a specific number of iterations.\n\nCode is written by Hanie Sedghi. \n\n\n",
