  "README.md": "# SamuBrain/SamuCopy\n\n## SamuBrain, exp. 4, cognitive mental organs: MPU (Mental Processing Unit), acquiring higher-order knowledge\n\nThis is the original experiment, see its page at https://github.com/nbatfai/SamuBrain\n\n## SamuBrain/SamuCopy, exp. 5: Classes of MPUs / Copy MPU, cognitive mental organs: MPU (Mental Processing Unit), COP-based Q-learning, acquiring higher-order knowledge\n\nCurrently I am working on a manuscript titled \"Samu in His Prenatal Development\" where I want to establish a definition of a mathematical machine for learning. It is for this reason that I have made various experiments on the subject.\n\nThe project called SamuBrain is an implementation of a version of the definition in question. In this experiment, I have been investigating the possibility of developing a \"cognitive mental organ\" which is called Mental Processing Unit (or briefly MPU) in the terminology of the sources of this project.\n\nAn MPU consisting of two lattices, one input and one output lattice. The input lattice (called reality) represents the perception of the agent. Each cell of the output lattice (called Samu's predictions) is equipped with \na [COP](http://arxiv.org/abs/1108.2865)-based\n[SAMU](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02889)  engine to predict the next state of the corresponding input cell. Three different inputs are shown to the agent in the experiment:\n\n1. 5 gliders move in the input lattice in accordance with Conway's Game of Life (https://github.com/nbatfai/SamuLife)\n2. 9 simple \"pictures\" are shown (https://github.com/nbatfai/SamuStroop)\n3. a simple \"film\" is shown (https://github.com/nbatfai/SamuMovie)\n\nThe agent must learn and recognize these complex patterns.\n\n### Copy MPUs\n\nWhilst the project SamuBrain uses arithmetical MPUs this tries to use a new kind of MPU called Copy MPU.\n\n## Usage\n\n```\ngit clone https://github.com/nbatfai/SamuCopy.git\ncd SamuCopy/\n~/Qt/5.5/gcc_64/bin/qmake SamuLife.pro\nmake\n./SamuCopy 2>out\n```\n\n```\ntail -f out|grep \"HIGHER-ORDER NOTION MONITOR\"\n```\n\n```\ntail -f out|grep SENSITIZATION\n```\n\n```\ntail -f out|grep \"HABITUATION MONITOR\" \n```\n\n\n## Experiments with this project\n\n### The initial experiment\n\n![screenshot from 2016-02-12 14-58-39](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/3148120/13008899/9f6b8ce8-d199-11e5-939a-08705f26f6dc.png)\n\n[https://youtu.be/QauECS6HgzY](https://youtu.be/QauECS6HgzY)\n\n## Previous other experiments\n\nSamu (Nahshon)\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02889,\nhttps://github.com/nbatfai/nahshon\n\n---\n\nSamuLife\nhttps://github.com/nbatfai/SamuLife,\nhttps://youtu.be/b60m__3I-UM\n\nSamuMovie\nhttps://github.com/nbatfai/SamuMovie,\nhttps://youtu.be/XOPORbI1hz4\n\nSamuStroop\nhttps://github.com/nbatfai/SamuStroop,\nhttps://youtu.be/6elIla_bIrw,\nhttps://youtu.be/VujHHeYuzIk\n\nSamuBrain\nhttps://github.com/nbatfai/SamuBrain\n\nSamuCopy\nhttps://github.com/nbatfai/SamuCopy\n\n---\n\nSamuTicker\nhttps://github.com/nbatfai/SamuTicker\n\nSamuVocab\nhttps://github.com/nbatfai/SamuVocab\n",
