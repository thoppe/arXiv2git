  "description": "An Applescript that renames and archives PDFs downloaded from arxiv.org", 
  "README.md": "arXiver\n=======\n\narXiver is an AppleScript that automatically renames and archives PDFs downloaded from arxiv.org. \n\nNormally, PDFs downloaded from arXiv.org have a non-descript name that corresponds to their arXiv identifier,\nfor example `1206.7095.pdf`. These files names are not particular well suited for searching them with Spotlight,\nunless you know the identifier by heart.\narXiver renames the PDFs to `\"identifier\" \"list of authors\" - \"title\".pdf`, such that you can easily search\nfor an author or paper title with Spotlight. It also moves the renamed PDFs to a custom directory, \ndisplays a Growl notification doing so.\n\n\nHow to install\n--------------\n\n1. Download the [arXiver applescript file](https://raw.github.com/teake/arXiver/master/arXiver.applescript), \n   and open it with the AppleScript Editor. \n2. Adjust the `archiveDir` variable to where you want to the PDFs after hey have been removed (note: this should be \n   a POSIX path, not an alias).\n3. Save the script as a compiled script (the `Script` file format) in `~/Library/Scripts/Folder Action Scripts`. \n   If this directory doesn't exist, create it.\n4. (Optional) Run the script once from the Applescript Editor in order to register the Growl notifications. \n5. Enable Folder Actions by right-clicking your download directory and selecting `Services -> Folder Action Setup`.` \n   Select the previously saved arXiver script and enable it.\n6. Lastly, download and install the [XML Tools](http://www.latenightsw.com/freeware/xml-tools/) for AppleScript.\n\n\nLimitations\n-----------\n\narXiver determines whether a file has been downloaded from arxiv.org via its metadata. \nBecause Firefox doesn't store this metadata, arXiver only works with PDFs downloaded in Safari or Chrome.\n",
