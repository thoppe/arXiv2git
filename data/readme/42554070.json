This code is implemented in [Torch7](http://torch.ch/) (written in Lua); more documentation is given in the README in that subdirectory.\n \n\n* [MemN2N-babi-matlab](MemN2N-babi-matlab): The code for the MemN2N bAbI task experiments of Section 4 of the paper:\n\n     [S. Sukhbaatar, A. Szlam, J. Weston, R. Fergus. End-To-End Memory Networks. arXiv:1503.08895](http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.08895).\n \n  This code is implemented in Matlab; more documentation is given in the README in that subdirectory.\n\n### Other 3rd party implementations\n* [python-babi](https://github.com/vinhkhuc/MemN2N-babi-python): MemN2N implemenation on bAbI tasks with very nice interactive demo.\n* [theano-babi](https://github.com/npow/MemN2N): MemN2N implementation in Theano for bAbI tasks.\n* [tf-lang](https://github.com/carpedm20/MemN2N-tensorflow): MemN2N language model implementation in TensorFlow.\n* [tf-babi](https://github.com/domluna/memn2n): Another MemN2N implementation of MemN2N in TensorFlow, but for bAbI tasks.\n",
