The main idea is to estimate the false discovery proportion among the top k hypotheses in the ranked list, for each k=1,...,n, to determine an adaptive cutoff for the list. We aim to find a cutoff k that enables us to discover as many true signals as possible while controlling the false discovery rate. For more information, see the paper. \n\nPotential applications of this project are: 1. Allow us to leverage prior experiment and testing results to boost discoveries in new experimental data; 2. Provide a high dimensional linear model selection approach that controls the false detection of irrelevant predictors.\n\nHere we give code in the R language providing an implementation of the accumulation test method, and reproducing the empirical results in the paper.\nDescription of files in this repository:\n\naccumulation_test_functions.R -- R script to implement the accumulation test methods\n\nShortDemo.R, ShortDemo.pdf -- Here we create a sequence of hypotheses and p-values, and running accumulation test methods to test these hypotheses.  These two files are the R scripts and results (visualizations).\n\nsimulation.R, simulation.pdf -- Here we reproduce the simulated data results in the paper. These two files are the R scripts and results (visualizations).\n\ngene_dosage_experiment.R, gene_dosage_experiment.pdf -- Here we reproduce the gene dosage data results in the paper. These two files are the R scripts and results (visualizations).\n",
