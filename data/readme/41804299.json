Building the System\n----------------------\n\n1.1 Overview\n\nSemanticPaint builds with CMake 2.8 and above on Windows, Ubuntu and Mac OS X.\nIt has been tested on recent versions of all three operating systems, but may\nrequire additional work to build on older versions.\n\n1.2 Dependencies\n\nSemanticPaint depends on various 3rd party libraries. Some of these are\nrequired, in the sense that SemanticPaint will not function without them;\nothers are optional, but skipping them will reduce functionality.\n\nSuitable versions of the required dependencies and some of the optional\ndependencies have been included in the repository, so SemanticPaint should\nbuild \"out of the box\". However, most users will probably want to install\nthe remaining optional libraries in order to enable full functionality.\n\n  - ArrayFire\n    Status: Optional (needed for touch interaction and median filtering)\n    Default: Disabled\n    Flag: WITH_ARRAYFIRE\n\n  - Boost (version 1.56.0)\n    Status: Required\n\n  - CUDA (version 6.5)\n    Status: Optional (needed for GPU acceleration)\n    Default: Enabled\n    Flag: WITH_CUDA\n\n  - Eigen (version 3.2.2)\n    Status: Required\n\n  - GLEW (version 1.12.0)\n    Status: Required on Windows/Ubuntu\n\n  - InfiniTAM (version 2)\n    Status: Required\n\n  - Leap Motion SDK (version 2.2.1.24116)\n    Status: Optional (needed for experimental Leap Motion support)\n    Default: Disabled\n    Flag: WITH_LEAP\n\n  - Oculus SDK (version 0.5.0.1)\n    Status: Optional (needed for Oculus Rift support)\n    Default: Disabled\n    Flag: WITH_OVR\n\n  - OpenCV (version 2.4.9)\n    Status: Optional (needed for feature inspection mode)\n    Default: Disabled\n    Flag: WITH_OPENCV\n\n  - OpenGL\n    Status: Required\n\n  - OpenMP\n    Status: Optional, but recommended (needed for faster training/prediction)\n    Default: Disabled\n    Flag: WITH_OPENMP\n    Notes: Doesn't work on Mac OS X\n\n  - OpenNI (version 2)\n    Status: Optional, but recommended (needed for live reconstruction)\n    Default: Disabled\n    Flag: WITH_OPENNI\n\n  - SDL (version 2-2.0.3)\n    Status: Required\n\n  - Vicon SDK\n    Status: Optional (needed for the Vicon tracker)\n    Default: Disabled\n    Flag: WITH_VICON\n\n1.3 Build Process\n\nCommon steps on all platforms:\n\n  a) Choose a root directory, hereafter referred to as <root>.\n\n  b) Clone the InfiniTAM repository into <root>/InfiniTAM.\n\n  c) Build the spaint_v2 branch of InfiniTAM using CMake (using <root>/InfiniTAM/InfiniTAM/build as your build directory).\n\n  d) Clone SemanticPaint into <root>/spaint, e.g.\n\n     $ git clone git@github.com:torrvision/spaint.git spaint\n\n  e) Change to the spaint directory:\n\n     $ cd spaint\n\n1.3.1 Build Process (Windows)\n\n  f) Using a Bash shell (e.g. Git Bash, provided with msysgit), run the top-level build script, e.g. for VS2013:\n\n    $ ./build-win.sh 12 Release\n\n  g) Run the CMake GUI and specify <root>/spaint/build as the build directory.\n\n  h) Enable any optional libraries you want and supply the paths.\n\n  i) Reconfigure and regenerate the Visual Studio solution.\n\n  j) Build with the optional libraries enabled (just run the above build command again).\n\n1.3.2 Build Process (Unix)\n\n  f) Run the top-level build script:\n\n     $ ./build-nix.sh \"Unix Makefiles\" Release\n\n  g) Change to the build directory and run ccmake:\n\n     $ cd build\n     $ ccmake ..\n\n  h) Enable any optional libraries you want and supply the paths.\n\n  i) Reconfigure and regenerate the makefile.\n\n  j) Build with the optional libraries enabled, e.g.\n\n     $ make -j4\n\n2.

Additional Documentation\n---------------------------\n\nFurther details about the original concept for SemanticPaint can be\nfound in the following paper:\n\nSemanticPaint: Interactive 3D Labeling and Learning at your Fingertips.\nACM Transactions on Graphics, 34(5), August 2015.\n\nThere will shortly be a technical report shipped along with this\npackage to describe the details of our open-source implementation\nof the SemanticPaint framework. It is currently in the process of\nbeing written.\n\n4. Troubleshooting Tips\n-----------------------\n\nIf you have any trouble with the build, here are some of the likely causes:\n\n* The CMake executable is not on your path.\n* The MSBuild executable is not on your path.

  "README.md": "# SemanticPaint: A Framework for Interactive, Real-Time 3D Scene Segmentation\n\n![teaser](teaser.png)\n\n*Project page:* [http://www.semantic-paint.com](http://www.semantic-paint.com)\n\nThis is an open-source, real-time implementation of the interactive *SemanticPaint* system for geometric reconstruction, object-class segmentation and learning of 3D scenes, originally published in [Valentin15]. Using our system, a user can walk into a room wearing a depth camera and a virtual reality headset, and both densely reconstruct the 3D scene [Newcombe11,Niessner13,Kaehler15] and interactively segment the environment into object classes such as 'chair', 'floor' and 'table'. The user interacts *physically* with the real-world scene, touching objects and using voice commands to assign them appropriate labels. These user-generated labels are leveraged by an online random forest-based machine learning algorithm, which is used to predict labels for previously unseen parts of the scene. The entire pipeline runs in real time, and the user stays 'in the loop' throughout the process, receiving immediate feedback about the progress of the labelling and interacting with the scene as necessary to refine the predicted segmentation.\n\nThis version of the *SemanticPaint* concept was implemented by [Stuart Golodetz](http://research.gxstudios.net) and [Michael Sapienza](http://sites.google.com/site/mikesapi), under the supervision of [Professor Philip Torr](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~tvg).\n\nIt is built on top of [InfiniTAM v2](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~victor/infinitam/index.html), a highly efficient, open-source 3D reconstruction engine developed by Oxford's [Active Vision Group](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/OxVisionLib). Anyone interested in InfiniTAM should contact either [Victor Adrian Prisacariu](mailto:victor@viprad.net) or [Olaf Kaehler](mailto:olaf@robots.ox.ac.uk).\n\nThe original concept for *SemanticPaint* was developed by a large number of people both at the University of Oxford and at Microsoft Research: Julien Valentin, Vibhav Vineet, Ming-Ming Cheng, David Kim, Shahram Izadi, Jamie Shotton, Pushmeet Kohli, Matthias Niessner, Antonio Criminisi and Philip H S Torr.\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\nWe gratefully acknowledge the help of Julien Valentin, for his help in getting us up to speed with the project, of Victor Adrian Prisacariu, Olaf Kaehler and Carl Yuheng Ren, for implementing the 3D reconstruction engine on which our work is based, without which our work would not be possible, of Anurag Arnab, for his help with the saving and loading of scenes, and of Stephen Hicks and Joram van Rheede, for helping us to exhibit our work at SIGGRAPH 2015.\n\n## Context\n\nScene understanding has many applications both within Computer Vision and beyond, but our primary motivation comes from a project led by [Stephen Hicks](http://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/team/stephen-hicks) to build augmented-reality glasses for the partially-sighted. Please read about it [here](http://www.va-st.com/smart-specs/).\n\n## Publications\n\nIf you build on this framework for your research, please consider citing both our technical report that describes this implementation of the *SemanticPaint* concept, and the original research paper by Valentin *et al.*:\n```\n@techreport{Golodetz2015,\n  author = {Stuart Golodetz* and Michael Sapienza* and Julien P C Valentin and Vibhav Vineet and Ming-Ming Cheng and Anurag Arnab and Victor A Prisacariu and Olaf K{\\\"a}hler and Carl Yuheng Ren and David W Murray and Shahram Izadi and Philip H S Torr},\n  title = {{SemanticPaint: A Framework for the Interactive Segmentation of 3D Scenes}},\n  institution = {Department of Engineering Science, University of Oxford},\n  number = {TVG-2015-1},\n  note = {Released as arXiv e-print 1510.03727},\n  month = {October},\n  year = {2015}\n}\n```\n\n```\n@article{Valentin2015,\n  author = {Julien Valentin and Vibhav Vineet and Ming-Ming Cheng and David Kim and Jamie Shotton and Pushmeet Kohli and Matthias Niessner and Antonio Criminisi and Shahram Izadi and Philip H S Torr},\n  title = {{SemanticPaint: Interactive 3D Labeling and Learning at your Fingertips}},\n  journal = {ACM Transactions on Graphics},\n  volume = {34},\n  number = {5},\n  year = {2015}\n}\n```\n\n# Installation Guide\n\n## 1.
