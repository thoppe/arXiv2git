  "README.asciidoc": "SediFoam: A general-purpose, open-source CFD-DEM solver for particle-laden flows\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nHeng Xiao <hengxiao@vt.edu>\n\nSediFoam is a hybrid CFD--DEM solver for particle-laden flows based on two open-source codes: OpenFOAM, an object-oriented CFD platform by OpenCFD, and LAMMPS, a highly efficient molecular dynamics solver by Sandia National Laboratories. The algorithms used in this solver are published in Xiao and Sun <<Xiao2011>>, Sun and Xiao <<Sun2015a>>, <<Sun2015b>>, and Gupta et al.<<Gupta2015a>>. The solver has ben rigorously and extensively validated <<Gupta2015b>>. A capability demonstration of the present solver in the context of sediment transport is published in Sun and Xiao <<Sun2016>>. Other application include sand dune migration <<Sun2016b>>.\n\nMore information can be found at the https://github.com/xiaoh/sediFoam/wiki[wiki pages] of this site.\n\nDevelopment: Rui Sun (2013-present), Heng Xiao (2008-present), Jin Sun (2008-2010) +\nWith contributions from: Prashant Gupta +\nSend bug reports and comments to: Heng Xiao (hengxiao@vt.edu) +\n\n[bibliography]\nReferences\n----------\n\n[bibliography]\n- [[[Sun2016]]] R.
