  "README.md": "# Bayesian Subset Simulation (BSS)\n\nThis repository provides an implementation of the \"Bayesian Subset Simulation\"\n(BSS) algorithm described in the following preprint:\n\nJulien Bect, Ling Li & Emmanuel Vazquez  \n_Bayesian Subset Simulation_  \n[arXiv:1601.02557v1](http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.02557   \"arXiv:1601.02557v1\")\n\nIt is currently in a very preliminary form.\nAfter some polishing, it will (sooner or later) become\npart of the [STK toolbox](https://sourceforge.net/projects/kriging/\n\"The STK toolbox on SourceForge\").\n\n\n## Requirements\n\nYou need an interpreter of the Matlab/Octave langage, that is, either\nMathworks's [Matlab](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/ \"Matlab\") or\n[GNU Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/ \"GNU Octave\").\n\nThe result presented in arXiv:1601.02557v1 were obtained using Matlab R2014b.\nPlease report any problem with other versions of Matlab or with Octave.\nSince BSS is meant to become part of the STK toolbox, it should ideally run with\nMatlab >=R2007a and Octave >=3.2.2 (those are the current requirements indicated\nin STK's README). Right now, it probably doesn't...\n\nYou will also need a development version of the STK toolbox (since the latest\npublic release of STK, which is 2.3.4, does not contain the `stk_pmisclass`\nfunction that we use in BSS).  You can obtain it using Mercurial or by\ndownloading a snapshot of the default branch (see below).\n\n\n## Installation\n\n 1. Clone the BSS repository wherever you like:\n\n        git clone https://github.com/jbect/bss.git bss\n        \n   (or download and unpack a zip [snapshot of the\n    repo](https://github.com/jbect/bss/archive/master.zip\n    \"Download a snapshot of BSS's master branch\")).\n\n 2. Clone STK's default branch inside it:\n\n        cd bss\n        hg clone http://hg.code.sf.net/p/kriging/hg stk\n        \n   (or download and unpack a tarball [snapshot of the\n   repo](https://sourceforge.net/p/kriging/hg/ci/default/tarball\n   \"Download a snapshot of STK's default branch\")).\n\n 3. Start Matlab or Octave and then type\n\n        bss_init\n\n    to initialize BSS (and STK).  That's all, you're ready to use BSS.\n\n\n## Test\n\nYou can test that BSS works as expected by running the test script:\n\n    script_test_bss\n\nThe results are summarized at the end in a table that should look like this:\n\n    case #001:  DIM=6  pf_estim=1.05e-05  pf_ref=9.09e-06  ratio=1.15e+00  \n    case #002:  DIM=6  pf_estim=1.77e-08  pf_ref=1.56e-08  ratio=1.13e+00  \n    case #003:  DIM=2  pf_estim=4.15e-06  pf_ref=3.94e-06  ratio=1.05e+00  \n    case #004:  DIM=2  pf_estim=7.19e-09  pf_ref=5.49e-09  ratio=1.31e+00  \n    case #005:  DIM=1  pf_estim=8.26e-06  pf_ref=1.00e-05  ratio=8.26e-01  \n    case #006:  DIM=1  pf_estim=1.07e-05  pf_ref=1.00e-05  ratio=1.07e+00  \n    case #101:  DIM=2  pf_estim=1.37e-04  pf_ref=2.03e-04  ratio=6.73e-01 \n\nThe ratios reported in the last column should be reasonably close to one.\n\n\n## Licence\n\nCopyright (C) 2016 CentraleSupelec\n\nThis library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or\nmodify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public\nLicense as published by the Free Software Foundation; either\nversion 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.\n\nThis library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
