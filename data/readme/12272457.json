New planets are usually added within 24 hours of their announcement.\n\nThe database is licensed under an MIT license (see below), which basically says you can do everything with it. If you use it for a scientific publication, please include a reference to the Open Exoplanet Catalogue on [github](https://github.com/OpenExoplanetCatalogue/open_exoplanet_catalogue) or to [this arXiv paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.7121).  \n\nThe catalogue is a community project. Please send corrections and additions via pull request or [email](mailto:exoplanet@hanno-rein.de). If you have questions or comments about git or the database, please do not hesitate to contact of the contributors directly.\n\nIf you are looking for a simple comma/tab separated table, you might want to check out [this repository](https://github.com/OpenExoplanetCatalogue/oec_tables/).\n\nHow to access the catalogue using Python \n--------------\nIt is very easy to access the Open Exoplanet Catalogue using python. Here is a short [snippet](https://gist.github.com/hannorein/2a069763cf114f66641c) to print out some basic planet data. No download, no installation and no external libraries are required.\n\n```python\n# python 2.x\nimport xml.etree.ElementTree as ET, urllib, gzip, io\nurl = \"https://github.com/OpenExoplanetCatalogue/oec_gzip/raw/master/systems.xml.gz\"\noec = ET.parse(gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=io.BytesIO(urllib.urlopen(url).read())))\n \n# Output mass and radius of all planets \nfor planet in oec.findall(\".//planet\"):\n    print [planet.findtext(\"mass\"), planet.findtext(\"radius\")]\n \n# Find all circumbinary planets \nfor planet in oec.findall(\".//binary/planet\"):\n    print planet.findtext(\"name\")\n \n# Output distance to planetary system (in pc, if known) and number of planets in system\nfor system in oec.findall(\".//system\"):\n    print system.findtext(\"distance\"), len(system.findall(\".//planet\"))\n```\n\nIf you are using python 3, replace the first three lines by \n\n```python\nimport xml.etree.ElementTree as ET, urllib.request, gzip, io\nurl = \"https://github.com/OpenExoplanetCatalogue/oec_gzip/raw/master/systems.xml.gz\"\noec = ET.parse(gzip.GzipFile(fileobj=io.BytesIO(urllib.request.urlopen(url).read())))\n```\n\nData Structure\n-------------\nThe following table shows all the possible tags in the Open Exoplanet Catalogue. \n\n| Tag      | Can be child of | Description | Unit |\n| -------- | --------------- | ----------- | ---- |\n| `system` |                 | This is the root container for an entire planetary system |  |\n| ` planet` | `system`, `binary`, `star` | This is the container for a single planet. The planet is a free floating (orphan) planet if this tag is a child of `system`. | \n| `star`  | `system`, `binary` | This is the container for a single star. A star can be host to one or more planets (circum-stellar planets). | \n| `binary` \t\t| `system`, `binary` | A binary consists of either two stars, one star and one binary or two binaries. In addition a binary can be host to one or more planets (circum-binary planets).| |\n| | | | |\n| `declination`\t| `system` | Declination | +/- dd mm ss   |\n| `rightascension`\t| `system` | Right ascension | hh mm ss   |\n| `distance`\t\t| `system` | Distance from the Sun | parsec   |\n| `name`\t\t| `system`, `binary`, `star`, `planet` | Name of this object. This tag can be used multiple times if the object has multiple Names. |   |\n| `semimajoraxis` \t| `binary`, `planet` | Semi-major axis of a planet (heliocentric coordinates) if child of `planet`. Semi-major axis of the binary if child of `binary`. |  AU |\n| `separation`\t \t| `binary`, `planet` | Projected separation of planet from its host, or if child of `binary` the projected separation from one component to the other. This tag can occur multiple times with different units. It is different from the tag `semimajoraxis` as it does not imply a specific orbital configuration. |  AU, arcsec |\n| `positionangle` | `binary` | Position angle | degree |\n| `eccentricity` \t| `binary`, `planet` | Eccentricity  | |\n| `periastron` \t| `binary`, `planet` | Longitude of periastron | degree  |\n| `longitude` \t| `binary`, `planet` | Mean longitude at a given Epoch (same for all planets in one system) | degree  |\n| `meananomaly`\t| `binary`, `planet` | Mean anomaly at a given Epoch (same for all planets in one system) | degree  |\n| `ascendingnode` \t| `binary`, `planet` | Longitude of the ascending node | degree  |\n| `inclination` \t| `binary`, `planet` | Inclination of the orbit | degree  |\n| `impactparameter`\t| `planet` | Impact parameter of transit | |\n| `epoch` | `system` | Epoch for the orbital elements | BJD |\n| `period`\t \t| `binary`, `planet` | Orbital period   | day  |\n| `transittime` | `binary`, `planet` | Time of the center of a transit | BJD |\n| `periastrontime` | `binary`, `planet` | Time of periastron | BJD |\n| `maximumrvtime` | `binary`, `planet` | Time of maximum radial velocity | BJD |\n| `mass`\t\t| `planet`, `star` |Mass (or m sin(i) for radial velocity planets) | Jupiter masses (`planet`), Solar masses (`star`)  |\n| `radius`\t\t| `planet`, `star` |Physical radius | Jupiter radii (`planet`), Solar radii (`star`)  |\n| `temperature`\t| `planet`, `star` |Temperature (surface or equilibrium) | Kelvin  |\n| `age`\t\t| `planet`, `star` |Age | Gyr  |\n| `metallicity`\t| `star` | Stellar metallicity  | log, relative to solar  |\n| `spectraltype`\t| `star`, `planet` | Spectral type  |   |\n| `magB`\t\t| `binary`, `star`, `planet` | B magnitude |   |\n| `magV`\t\t| `binary`, `star`, `planet` | Visual magnitude |   |\n| `magR`\t\t| `binary`, `star`, `planet` | R magnitude |   |\n| `magI`\t\t| `binary`, `star`, `planet` | I magnitude |   |\n| `magJ`\t\t| `binary`, `star`, `planet` | J magnitude |   |\n| `magH`\t\t| `binary`, `star`, `planet` | H magnitude |   |\n| `magK`\t\t| `binary`, `star`, `planet` | K magnitude |   |\n| | | | |\n| `image` \t\t| `planet` | Filename without extension of a picture of the planet.

We assume that these uncertainties represent the standard error of the measurement (68.2% confidence level). However, keep in mind that it is often not possible to collapse an entire posterior distribution to a single number.\n\nThe syntax for error bars is: `<mass errorminus=\"0.1\" errorplus=\"0.1\">1.0</mass>`\n\nThe syntax for upper/lower limits is: `<mass upperlimit=\"1.0\" />`\n\nConstants\n-------------\nThere are several constant used in defining the units in the Open Exoplanet Catalogue. The following table can be used to convert them into SI units.\n\n| Constant used in catalogue | Definition in SI units |\n| -------- | --------------- |\n| Jupiter mass | 1.8991766e+27 kg |\n| Solarmass | 1.9891e+30 kg |\n| Jupiter radius | 69911000 m |\n| Solarradius | 6.96e+08 m |\n\n\nPlots\n-------------\n![Mass vs semi-major axis](https://raw.github.com/OpenExoplanetCatalogue/oec_plots/master/plot_mass_vs_semimajoraxis_discovery.svg.png \"Plot\")\n![Architecture](https://raw.github.com/OpenExoplanetCatalogue/oec_plots/master/plot_architecture.svg.png \"Plot\")\n![Discovery year](https://raw.github.com/OpenExoplanetCatalogue/oec_plots/master/plot_discoveryyear.svg.png \"Plot\")\n![Period ratios](https://raw.github.com/OpenExoplanetCatalogue/oec_plots/master/plot_periodratio.svg.png \"Plot\")\n\nTo create custom plots please visit [this repository](https://github.com/OpenExoplanetCatalogue/oec_plots) for example scripts.\n\n\nDownload ASCII tables\n--------------\nA few words of caution: Many planetary systems are part of binary star systems. The architecture of these systems is correctly represented in the original XML files of the Open Exoplanet Catalogue. In fact, it is to my knowledge the only catalogue that can do that. However, you might prefer to work with a simpler comma or tab separated table instead of the hierarchical XML file format. During the conversion process, some information is inevitably lost. Most importantly, the architecture of the star system. One cannot easily represent an arbitrary binary/triple/quadruple system in a simple table. Additionally, if planets have multiple identifiers only the first identifier is outputted. Using the original XML file format and git, you can use the `git blame` functionality to find references to scientific publications for every numeric value in the database. This functionality is also lost in the conversion process.\n\nIn a [separate repository](https://github.com/OpenExoplanetCatalogue/oec_tables/), you will find a [comma separated](https://github.com/OpenExoplanetCatalogue/oec_tables/raw/master/comma_separated/open_exoplanet_catalogue.txt) and a [tab separated](https://github.com/OpenExoplanetCatalogue/oec_tables/blob/master/tab_separated/open_exoplanet_catalogue.txt) ASCII table of the Open Exoplanet Catalogue. \n\n\n\nDocumentation\n--------------\n[This file](https://raw.github.com/OpenExoplanetCatalogue/open_exoplanet_catalogue/master/oec_paper.pdf) describes the philosophy and data-format of the catalogue. However, everything should be rather self-explanatory. The actual data is in the `systems` directory. Each XML file corresponds to one planetary system. \n\nIf you are editing the file with vim, have a look at the [xmledit plugin](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=301). I found it very helpful.\n\n\nHow to include references to publications\n--------------\nIt seems that the most elegant place to put references to publications is the commit message.\nThis allows one to trace back each individual value in the database to the source using `git blame`. \nFurthermore it does not add any additional clutter to the text files themselves.\nSo, when committing any changes, please create one commit per publication and include the reference in the commit message from now on.\n\n\nDerived products\n--------------\nThe following list contains links to other catalogues, websites and apps that are derived from or make use of the Open Exoplanet Catalogue.\n\n * [oec_web](https://github.com/OpenExoplanetCatalogue/oec_web): A suite of HTML pages acting as a front-end of the Open Exoplanet Catalogue. It includes visualizations of orbits, planet sizes and habitable zones. It also includes a plotting tool to generate correlation diagrams. The website is hosted at [openexoplanetcatalogue.com](http://openexoplanetcatalogue.com).\n * [oec_plots](https://github.com/OpenExoplanetCatalogue/oec_plots): Plots and example scripts that make use of the Open Exoplanet Catalogue.\n * [oec_outreach](https://github.com/hannorein/oec_outreach): A clone of the main repository with images and tags that are mainly used for outreach purposes.\n * [oec_iphone](https://github.com/hannorein/oec_iphone): Compressed files, references to refereed publications, resized images and legacy support for various versions of the mobile version are in the repository.\n * [ExoData](https://github.com/ryanvarley/ExoData): A Python module for loading the catalogue into python for use with applications along with many exoplanet related equations and tools.\n * [iPhone Exoplanet App](http://exoplanetapp.com): Popular iOS application with many visualizations of the entire catalogue.
