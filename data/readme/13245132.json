(note added 2013-10-01)\n\n(this file is outdated!)\nPROGRAM IMPLEMENTATIONS OF THE WEISFEILER-LEMAN ALGORITHM\n\n   You have access to two different implementations:\n       1. the program   stabil\n       2. the program   stcol\n\n   For detailed descriptions of both programs we refer\n   to the technical report by\n       L. Babel, I.V. Chuvaeva, M. Klin, D.V. Pasechnik:\n         'Algebraic Combinatorics in Mathematical Chemistry.\n                   Methods and Algorithms.\n       II. Program Implementation of the Weisfeiler-Leman Algorithm'\n\n   The programs compute the cellular algebra W which is generated\n   by the adjacency matrix of any colored directed or undirected graph Gamma.\n \n   Both programs are written in programming language C\n   and will work on Unix computers. \n\n   In the current versions, the programs stabil and stcol will handle \n   graphs with up to 200 respectively 150 vertices.\n\nINPUT:\n   \n   Both programs require as an input a file containing the\n   following information about the colored graph Gamma:\n       1. Number of colors\n       2. Number of vertices\n       3. Adjacency matrix of Gamma\n\n   Note that the colors have to be denoted consecutively by 0,1,2,...\n   Furthermore, the colors in the diagonal of the adjacency matrix \n   have to be different from the other colors.\n   \n   Feasibility of the input is checked within the programs in \n   a preprocessing routine.\n\nOUTPUT:\n\n   Both programs provide as an output the following information\n   about the computed cellular algebra W:\n       1. Number of colors\n       2. Number of cells\n       3. Adjacency matrix of W\n\n\nHOW TO RUN THE PROGRAM:\n \n       Start the program with the command\n               stabil input_file                     resp.\n                stcol input_file \n\n\nEXAMPLE:\n \n     1. Create a file called input_file \n        (or choose any other name for this file)\n        which contains data like the following:\n\n\n              4\n              8\n              3  1  2  1  1  2  2  2\n              1  0  1  2  2  1  2  2\n              2  1  3  1  2  2  1  2\n              1  2  1  0  2  2  2  1 \n              1  2  2  2  0  1  2  1\n              2  1  2  2  1  3  1  2\n              2  2  1  2  2  1  0  1\n              2  2  2  1  1  2  1  3\n\n     \n     2. Run the program using the command:\n\n\n              stabil input_file \n\n\n     3. The output on the screen is:\n\n\n              number of colors: 8\n\n              number of cells:  2\n\n              adjacency matrix of the cellular algebra:\n\n              0   2   3   2   2   3   5   3 \n              4   1   4   6   6   4   6   7 \n              3   2   0   2   5   3   2   3 \n              4   6   4   1   6   7   6   4 \n              4   6   7   6   1   4   6   4 \n              3   2   3   5   2   0   2   3 \n              7   6   4   6   6   4   1   4 \n              3   5   3   2   2   3   2   0 \n\n\n\n    _____________________________________________________\n\n",
