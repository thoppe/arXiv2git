See the [README.md](UserCode/DaveWecker/README.md) file in the same directory for details. We also exposed a few more APIs to help make this and other examples easier to code.\n\n__2016/04/23 QLSA source code released__\n\nIn UserCode\\DaveWecker there's a new release of source code for the QLSA example that's built in to LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A;. See the [README.md](UserCode/DaveWecker/README.md) file in the same directory for details.\n\n__2016/03/11 New introduction videos__\n\nSeven new short videos have been posted to the [LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; Research site](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/liquid/)\n\n__2016/03/04 Outputting circuits for other Quantum Languages__\n\nWe've uploaded sample code that shows how to print out circuits for other quantum languages. This specific example shows how to parse a circuit and generate QASM code. See [UserCode example](https://github.com/msr-quarc/Liquid/tree/master/UserCode/DaveWecker) from DaveWecker\n\n__2016/02/04 The Microsoft Quantum Challenge__\n\nMicrosoft Research is delighted to announce its first Quantum Challenge based on the simulator for Language-Integrated Quantum Operations: LIQ<i>Ui</i>\\|&#x232A; from the QuArC Group.\nSee http://aka.ms/quantumchallenge for full details. Closing date: April 29, 2016.\n\n__2016/02/01 New Version Available (time to re-install)__\n\nWe are pleased to announce a major new version of LIQ<i>Ui</i>\\|&#x232A; that has been re-written to be fully portable (currently on Windows, Linux and OSX). We have also improved the licensing process and have removed the registration steps completely. *All* future issues *must* be logged against this version, so we encourage anyone who has already installed the software to download the new version.\n\nAs always, we encourage you to join our (low volume) mailing list (instructions below) so you will directly receive announcements like these.\n\n## What Is LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A;?\n\nLIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; is a simulation platform developed by the [Quantum Architectures and Computation](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/quarc/) team at Microsoft Research to aid in the exploration of quantum computation. \nLIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; stands for \"Language Integrated Quantum Operations\".  \nA quantum operation is usually referred to as a unitary operator (U) applied to a column state vector (also known as a ket: |>).\nThe \"i\" is just a constant scaling factor, hence the acronym.\n\nLIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; includes three simulators: \n* A full state vector simulator that tracks the detailed evolution of the quantum state\n* A stabilizer simulator based on CHP (Aaronson and Gottesman, http://arXiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406196)\n* A highly-optimized full state vector simulator for fermionic Hamiltonians\n\nLIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; is available under a [Microsoft Research license](LICENSE.md). \n\n## For More Information\n\nSee the [Microsoft Research project page on LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A;](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/liquid/)\nand the paper, [LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A;: A Software Design Architecture and Domain-Specific Language for Quantum Computing](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/209634/1402.4467.pdf).\n\nTo stay up to date on what we're doing with LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A;, please watch our repository and sign up for the LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; email list.\nTo sign up, send an email to LISTSERV@lists.research.microsoft.com with a one-line body reading:\n```\nSUB Liquid-news FirstName LastName\n```\nReplacing FirstName and LastName with your first and last names.\nIf you prefer to remain anonymous, you may instead send an email containing:\n```\nSUB Liquid-news anonymous\n```\n\n## How To Cite LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A;\n\nIf you use LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; in your research, please cite it as follows:\n* bibTex:\n```\n@misc{1402.4467,\n  author = {Dave Wecker and Krysta M.~Svore},\n  title = {{LIQU}i|>: {A} {S}oftware {D}esign {A}rchitecture and {D}omain-{S}pecific \n            {L}anguage for {Q}uantum {C}omputing},\n  year = {2014},\n  eprint = {1402.4467},\n  url = {arXiv:1402.4467v1}\n}\n```\n* Text: \n```\nD.

There is also a [tutorial video](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/video/default.aspx?id=258279) available that will take you through the basics.\n\nWe've also posted seven short videos to the [LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; Research site](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/liquid/). These include:\n* [Station Q Overview](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/video/default.aspx?id=263557)\n* [LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; Simulator History](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/video/default.aspx?id=263605)\n* [The Quantum Challenge](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/video/default.aspx?id=263584)\n* [LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; Quantum Simulator QuickStart](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/video/default.aspx?id=263046)\n* [LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; Quantum Error Correction](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/video/default.aspx?id=263597)\n* [LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; Simulation Optimization](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/video/default.aspx?id=263612)\n* [LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; Quantum Chemistry](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/video/default.aspx?id=263611)\n\nNote that this version of LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; is limited to a maximum of 23 physical qubits for full state vector simulation.\n\nIf you run into a problem or have a question, you can [post an issue](https://github.com/msr-quarc/Liquid/issues).\nIf you have other feedback, you can contact the LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; team at liquid@microsoft.com.\n",
