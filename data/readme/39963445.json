  "README.md": "# arXiv Author Search\n------\nThis is a python program to search arXiv's paper given an author. \nIt can also do institution verification and subject verification to find the paper published by \nthis author with a specific affiliation.\n\n# Dependencies\nfeedparser, urllib, numpy, pandas, pyprind, pdfminer\n\n# Usage\nIf we want to find papers authored by Yann Lecun, we can use author = arxiv(Lecun_Yann) to initialize. \nThen use author.parse() to query arXiv and parse the returned data. \n\n- author.count: number of papers\n- author.arxiv_id: paper's arxiv id\n- author.time: paper's submission time\n- author.title: paper's title\n- author.category: paper's category\n- author.pdf: paper's pdf link \n- author.subject: subjects of all of author's papers \n- author.contributor: paper's contributors\n\nIf we also want to find paper by Yann Lecun submitted with affiliation in NYU, we can use \nauthor.institution_verify(save=False, institution=['nyu', 'new york university'])\nIf save=True, it will download all papers and save them to local.\n\n# Note\ninstitution_verify() will download all papers returned by searching query, and please do not use this \nas a robot to get all available papers from arXiv! 'Indiscriminate automated downloads from arXiv are not premitted'.\nSee more information about this: http://arxiv.org/help/robots\n\n",
