A portion of the historic version of the code is available in the archive directory.  The archive directory includes instructions for running a script that will recreate all 62 best-fit models from the Galaxy Zoo: Mergers project.  The js directory contains a web page that can run the same models in your browser.\n\nThe current language implementations include:\n\n1. Fortran\n2. Java\n3. JavaScript\n\nCitations\n---------\nPlease cite the Astrophysics Source Code Library (ASCL) entry for JSPAM, [http://ascl.net/1511.002](http://ascl.net/1511.002).
