  "README.md": "# Online players' behavior\n\nThis repository contains the source code of an in-progress master research project (see [preliminary results](src/output/README.md)). Despite the importance of competitive games in the world, such as the multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) genre, there is still a lack of tools and researches based on behavior analysis to help players improve their strategies and skills. Therefore, to reduce this gap the project aims to analyze and characterize players' behavior in relation to performance using machine learning algorithms in the context of the [most popular](https://www.superdataresearch.com/market-data/esports-market-brief/) MOBA, [League of Legends](http://leagueoflegends.com/) (LoL).\n\n* Project author: [Fernando Felix do Nascimento Junior](https://linkedin.com/in/fernandofnjr)\n* Professor adviser: [Leandro Balby Marinho](https://linkedin.com/in/leandro-balby-marinho-28b696b)\n* Master degree Program in Computer Science of the Federal University of Campina Grande\n\n## Data\n\nThe project uses a set of historical matches provided by [Riot Games](http://www.riotgames.com/), LoL developer, from its application public interface ([API](https://developer.riotgames.com)). A match history contains data such as game mode, game type and identification number. It also contains basic information statistics of each participant in the match. The documentation of all statistics can be found in the [API Documentation](https://developer.riotgames.com/api/methods#!/1064).\n\n## Replication\n\nThe project uses two programming languages: Python to raw and parse the data and R to analyze it. Following some basic steps to reproduce or replicate the preliminary results:\n\n**Raw JSON matches**\n\n1. Configure the Riot API Key in `src/python/config.py`\n2. Change current working directory to `src/python/` through the terminal\n3. Run `pip install -r requeriments.txt` to install Python dependencies\n2. Run `python raw.py` to raw the data\n3. All rawed matches can be found in `src/dump/`\n\n**Parse rawed matches to CSV**\n\n1. Change current working directory to `src/python/` through the terminal\n2. Run `python parse.py` to parse all JSON mathces to a CSV file\n3. The created CSV file can be found in `src/data/`\n\n**Analyze the parsed data**\n\n1. Open `src/R/analysis.R`\n2. In `src/R/analysis.R`, edit `data = read.csv('../data/data.csv')` to read the CSV file created previously\n3. Change current working directory to `src/R/` through the terminal\n4. Run `Rscript analysis.R` to build the analysis\n5. The analysis output can be found in `src/output`\n\nEdit `src/python/config.py` to configure other settings (statistic attributes to parse, dump directory, etc.).\n\n## References\n\nC. C.
