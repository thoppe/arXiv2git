  "README.md": "This repository contains the Coq formalization of the results in the paper \"Homotopy-Initial Algebras in Type Theory\" by\nSteve Awodey, Nicola Gambino, and Kristina Sojakova, available at http://arxiv.org/abs/1504.05531.\n\nThe repository contains two files:\n\n1) The file \"two.v\" contains the formalization of the results found in chapters 2 and 3 of the paper (\"Bipointed Types\" and\n\"Homotopy-Initial Bipointed Types\").\n\n\n2) The file \"w.v\" contains the formalization of the results found in chapters 4 and 5 of the paper (\"Polynomial Functors and\nTheir Algebras\" and \"Homotopy-Initial Algebras\").\n\nThe files use the Coq Homotopy Type Theory (HoTT) library, found at https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT.\nThey are confirmed to run under commit a4658e60995ff7c841c7f70157d24cd85d418878 of the master branch, April 20, 2015,\nbut are likely to work under any subsequent commits as well.\n\nThe HoTT library comes with a pre-packaged version of the Coq system, so no separate installation of the latter is required.\nFor further instructions please refer to https://github.com/HoTT/HoTT/blob/master/INSTALL.md.\n\nRepository last updated: April 25, 2015.\nAuthors: Steve Awodey, Nicola Gambino, Kristina Sojakova.\nContact : awodey@cmu.edu nicola.gambino@gmail.com kristinas@cmu.edu.\n",
