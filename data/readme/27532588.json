Run compile.m to compile the mex files. \r\n\r\nBefore testing, you might want to download our pre-trained Random Forest model, which is available at http://jianghz.com/drfi/files/drfiModelMatlab.zip. Put it into the model folder.\r\n\r\nIf you want to train your own Random Forest regressor, check the trainAll.m for instructions. For more details, check out our technical report http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.5926v1.\r\n\r\nTested on Windows 7 64bit with MATLAB 2012b and Ubuntu 12.04 64bit with MATLAB 2012a.\r\n\r\nBugs, comments are welcome to hzjiang@mail.xjtu.edu.cn.\r\n",
