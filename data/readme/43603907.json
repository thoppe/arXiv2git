  "README.md": "# DeepBox: Learning Objectness with Convolutional Networks\n\nCreated by [Weicheng Kuo](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wckuo/) at UC Berkeley\n\n### Introduction\n\nFast DeepBox is a bounding box proposal re-ranker using ConvNets. It produces state-of-the-art bounding box proposal within 0.5s using a light-weight 4-layer network. Experiments on both PASCAL and COCO showed that DeepBox performs significantly better than Edge boxes in terms of Area under Curve and that the gain carries over to detection mAP. This implementation is based on Ross's Fast-RCNN codebase, thereby written in Python and C++/Caffe.\n\nDeepBox was initially described in an [arXiv paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.02146) and later published at ICCV 2015.\n\n### License\n\nFast DeepBox is released under the MIT License (refer to the LICENSE file for details).\n\n### Citing Fast DeepBox\n\nIf you find Fast DeepBox useful in your research, please consider citing:\n\n    @inproceedings{KuoICCV15DeepBox,\n        Author = {Weicheng Kuo, Bharath Hariharan, Jitendra Malik},\n        Title = {DeepBox:Learning Objectness with Convolutional Networks},\n        Booktitle = {International Conference on Computer Vision ({ICCV})},\n        Year = {2015}\n    }\n    \n### Contents\n1.

[Beyond the demo: training and testing](#beyond-the-demo-installation-for-training-and-testing-models)\n6. [Usage](#usage)\n7. [Extra downloads](#extra-downloads)\n\n### Requirements: software\n\n1. Requirements for `Caffe` and `pycaffe` (see: [Caffe installation instructions](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html))\n\n  *Note:* Caffe doesn't have to be built with support for Python layers!\n\n  You can download my [Makefile.config](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~wckuo/fast-dbox-data/Makefile.config) for reference.\n2. Python packages you might not have: `cython`, `python-opencv`, `easydict`\n3. MATLAB (required for running COCO evaluation)\n\n### Requirements: hardware\n\n1. A good GPU (e.g., Titan, K20, K40, ...) with at least 3G of memory suffices\n\n### Installation (sufficient for the demo)\n\n1. Clone the Fast DeepBox repository\n  ```Shell\n  git clone https://github.com/weichengkuo/fast-dbox.git\n  ```\n  \n2. We'll call the directory that you cloned Fast DeepBox into `FDBOX_ROOT`\n\n3. Build the Cython modules\n    ```Shell\n    cd $FDBOX_ROOT/src\n    make\n    ```\n    \n4. Build Caffe and pycaffe\n    ```Shell\n    cd $FDBOX_ROOT/caffe-fast-rcnn\n    # Now follow the Caffe installation instructions here:\n    #   http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html\n\n    # If you're experienced with Caffe and have all of the requirements installed\n    # and your Makefile.config in place, then simply do:\n    make -j8 && make pycaffe\n    ```\n    \n5. Download pre-computed Fast DeepBox models\n    ```Shell\n    cd $FDBOX_ROOT/output/default\n    ./scripts/fetch_fast_dbox_models.sh\n    ```\n\n    This will populate the `$FDBOX_ROOT/output/default` folder with `coco_train2014`,which contains a variety of models. These include multiscale/single-scale Fast DeepBox models and a multiscale sliding window model for training comparison.\n\n### Demo\n\n*After successfully completing [basic installation](#installation-sufficient-for-the-demo)*, you'll be ready to run the demo.\n\n**Python**\n\nTo run the demo\n```Shell\ncd $FDBOX_ROOT\npython ./tools/demo.py\n```\nBy default, visualization only shows top five proposals per image and their scores. Users can set the number of proposals they want to visualize by passing in --numboxes [Number of proposals] argument. There is another demo mode on full COCO dataset that user can choose by passing in --demo 0 argument. This allows users to visualize Fast DeepBox proposals on any frame of users' choice in COCO validation set, but requires users to download pre-computed Edge boxes proposals and install COCO dataset in full. \n\n### Beyond the basic demo: installation for full COCO demo, training and testing models\nHere are the steps to set up full functionalities of DeeBox package.\n\n1. Download pre-computed Edge boxes proposals\n    ```Shell\n    cd $FDBOX_ROOT/data\n    ./scripts/fetch_edge_box_data.sh\n    ```\n    The Edge boxes proposals are pre-computed in order to reduce installation requirements. This step is necessary for demo.\n\n2. Download COCO Matlab data \n    ```Shell\n    cd $FDBOX_ROOT/data\n    ./scripts/fetch_coco_matlab_data.sh\n    ```\n    This step downloads the Matlab COCO image ordering with which Edge boxes proposals are computed. Ground truth boxes would also be downloaded to enable evaluation.\n\n3. Set up Microsoft COCO directory by\n    ```Shell\n    cd $FDBOX_ROOT/data\n    ln -s PATH/TO/YOUR/COCO ./MSCOCO\n    ```\n    If you haven't installed COCO on your machine yet, you can follow the instructions on the following github page to download and compile all the data. \n   -[MSCOCO](https://github.com/pdollar/coco)\n\n4.  Download pre-trained ImageNet models\n\n    Pretrained ImageNet model for Alex net can be downloaded to initialize the DeepBox network training.\n    ```Shell\n    cd $FDBOX_ROOT\n    ./data/scripts/fetch_imagenet_models.sh\n    ```\n    Alternatively, users can initialize the training with our multiscale sliding window model in\n    ```Shell\n    $FDBOX_ROOT/output/default/coco_train2014/fast-dbox-slidwindow-multiscale.caffemodel\n    ```\n\n### Usage\n\n**Train** a Fast DeepBox proposer:\n\n```Shell\npython ./tools/train_net.py (Show all training options)\npython ./tools/train_net.py --gpu 0 (Train on GPU 0)\n```\nTrain output is written underneath `$FDBOX_ROOT/output/default/coco_train2014`.\n\n\n**Test** a Fast DeepBox proposer:\n\n```Shell\npython ./tools/test_net.py (Show all testing options)\npython ./tools/test_net.py --gpu 0 (Test on GPU 0)\npython ./tools/test_net.py --imdb coco_test-dev2015 (Test on Test-dev split)  \n```\n\nTest output is written underneath `$FDBOX_ROOT/output/default/coco_val2014` by default. If you test on test-dev, it will be underneath coco_test-dev2015 instead.\n\n**Full Demo** a pre-trained Fast DeepBox proposer on COCO val set\n\n```Shell\npython ./tools/demo.py (Show all demo options)\npython ./tools/demo.py --demo 0 --frame 0 --numboxes 5 (Demo on frame 0 of COCO val set showing top 5 proposals)\n```\n\n**Evaluate** the test result. This part is written in Matlab. First launch your Matlab in $FDBOX_ROOT. Then do the following:\n\n```Shell\ncd ./eval\neval_fast_dbox\nplot_fast_dbox(name)\n```\nThe evaluation output will be printed and the Recall-vs-NumOfProposals plots will be shown. \n\n### Extra-downloads\n\n  Pre-computed Fast DeepBox proposals on COCO train, val, and test-dev. \n  ```Shell\n  cd $FDBOX_ROOT/data\n  ./scripts/fetch_fast_dbox_models.sh\n  ```\n\n",
