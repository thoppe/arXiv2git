  "README.md": "# Adaptive power line interference canceller (Python version)\n\nThis is a Python implementation of the algorithm proposed in __Mohammad Reza Keshtkaran and Zhi Yang, \"A Fast, Robust Algorithm for Power Line Interference Cancellation in Neural Recording\", Journal of Neural Engineering 11 026017__, available from [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1402.6862.pdf). The Python version is port of the MATLAB code provided by [mrezak](https://github.com/mrezak) at [removePLI](https://github.com/mrezak/removePLI). Currently only the single channel version of the algorithm is implemented.\n\nThe [IPython Notebook](https://github.com/alafuzof/remove_pli/blob/master/test_remove_pli.ipynb) shows how the code may be used and compares the results of the Python and MATLAB implementations.\n",
