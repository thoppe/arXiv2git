This is the proportion of intervals for which the second term, given in the paper above, vanishes.\nIt is called with three inputs m, n and p. Where it will loop through all interval [sigma,pi] with |sigma| <= m and |pi| <= n.\nAnd p is 0 or 1 indicating whether or not to print the intervals which have MF!=NE. If no p is included it's assumed to be 0.\nFor example:\njava mobLoop 5 8 0\n",
