  "README.md": "## [Orbital Probability Density Function (oPDF)](http://kambrian.github.io/oPDF)\n`oPDF` is a code for modelling the phase space distribution of steady-state tracers in spherical potentials. It is written in `C` and parallelized with `OpenMP` for speed, with a `Python` frontend for ease of use. It is also highly modularized and easily extensible.\n\n## Documentation\n\n- [Full HTML documentations](http://kambrian.github.io/oPDF/doc). \n\n  The [tutorial](http://kambrian.github.io/oPDF/doc/tutorial) is the best place to start from. \n\n- PDF versions are available in the doc/ directory.\n\nPlease consult the science paper (http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.00769) on how it works. \n\n## Authors\nJiaxin Han (@Kambrian)[ICC, Durham]\n",
