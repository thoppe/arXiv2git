However, this simplistic approach systematically disfavours low-degree nodes and the structures they represent.Therefore, we need to measure the significance of an edge, with respect to the degrees of its incident vertices. \n\nHere, we do this using a version of the configuration model as our null model that defines what we expect an edge's weight to be given its end-nodes' degrees. The null model predicts a probability distribution for the value of the edge weight. By comparing the observed weight of an edge with this predicted distribution, we can then compute a p-value which tells us how surprising the observed value is given the null model. This p-value gives us a measure of the statistical significance of the edge, and we can filter the edges according to this significance rather than the raw weight itself.\n\n- More: http://www.naviddianati.com/research\n- Link to paper: http://arxiv.org/abs/1503.04085\n- HTML version of paper: http://www.naviddianati.com/papers/graphpruning/html/manuscript.html\n\n",
