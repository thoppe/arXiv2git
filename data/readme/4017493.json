  "README.markdown": "Overview\n--------\n\nThis package contains cython code implementing a geometric variational integrator for the dynamics of point vortices of the sphere.  The discrete equations of motion live on the three-dimensional sphere/the Lie group SU(2), which allows for techniques from discrete Lagrangian mechanics to be used.  More information can be found in the following article: \n\n> Joris Vankerschaver, Melvin Leok: \n> _A novel formulation of point vortex dynamics on the sphere: geometrical and numerical aspects_. Journal of Nonlinear Science (2014), Volume 24, Issue 1, pp 1-37\n> [arXiv preprint](http://arxiv.org/abs/1211.4560)\n\nHow to run this thing\n---------------------\n\nFirst, compile the included Cython files by running \n\n    cd hopf && make\n\nThis has to be done only once.\n\nIn order to use this package, your PYTHONPATH has to point to the `hopf` directory. From within the root directory (`hopf_vortices`) of this package, run\n\n    source set_python_path.sh\n\n",
