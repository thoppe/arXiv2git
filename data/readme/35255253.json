  "readme.txt": "\nThis software package consists of a simple implementation of\nMC-AIXI-CTW, an intelligent agent that learns from experience\nhow to perform well in a wide variety of environments. This\nincludes, but is not limited to the example games provided in\nthis package, such as Tic Tac Toe, Pacman, and Kuhn Poker.\n\nThe package consists of:\n* tutorial: contains a brief tutorial to using the MC-AIXI-CTW software\n* src: contains the source code for the agent\n* conf: contains configuration files\n* doc: contains the automatically generated documentation\n  doc/html/index.html: starting point for HTML documentation\n* graph: contains generated graphs\n* log: contains log files. The project comes with log files generated by allowing the agent to explore for 5000 cycles then evaluating the performance of the learned policy for another 5000 cycles.\n\nThe latest version of this software can be downloaded from\nhttp://www.hutter1.net/publ/aixictwxcode.zip\n\nA scientific motivation and description of MC-AIXI-CTW can be found in\n\nJ.Veness, K.S.Ng, M.Hutter, W.Uther, D.Silver,\nA Monte Carlo AIXI Approximation,\nJournal of Artificial Intelligence Research, 40 (2011) 95-142\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1613/jair.3125\nFree TechReport version: http://arxiv.org/abs/0909.0801\nBibTeX: http://www.hutter1.net/official/bib.htm#aixictwx\n",
