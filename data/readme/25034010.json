Eppstein, M. Loffler, and D. Strash**,\nJournal of Experimental Algorithmics, 18 (3): 3.1, 2013, \n[doi:10.1145/2543629](https://doi.org/10.1145/2543629)\n\nand\n\n*Listing All Maximal Cliques in Large Sparse Real-World Graphs*, \n**D. Eppstein and D. Strash**\nProceedings of the 10th International Conference on Experimental Algorithms (SEA 2011), LNCS vol. 6630, pp. 403-414.\n[doi:10.1007/978-3-642-20662-7_31](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-642-20662-7_31)\n[arXiv:1103.0318](https://arxiv.org/abs/1103.0318)\n\nHowever, in the original implementation (written in C) was not designed to be integrated with other code. It has since been upgraded to C++11, is becoming more hardened, and has better support for integration into other software packages.\n\nWant the exact code from the original experiments? See release v1.0.\n\n###This package includes:\n\n - C++ code for four implementations for enumerating all maximal cliques of a graph\n - A small set of data used for testing (see ./data) [ For a larger set of data (too large for GitHub), you can download the following: http://www.ics.uci.edu/~dstrash/data.tar.gz ]\n - The test script used to build and run all algorithms on all data sets (./test.sh)\n\nPlease feel free to contact me with any questions!\n\n### Version\n2.0beta\n\n### Building\n\n```sh\n$ git clone https://github.com/darrenstrash/quick-cliques.git\n$ cd quick-cliques\n$ make\n```\n\n### Running\n```sh\n$ ./bin/qc --input-file=<input graph> --algorithm=<algorithm name>\n```\n\nor\n\n```sh\n$ ./test.sh\n```\n\nto run all algorithms on all data sets in data directory\n\nCopyright\n----\n\nCopyright (c) 2011-2016 Darren Strash.\n\n\nLicense\n----\n\nThis code is released under the GNU Public License (GPL) 3.0.\n\nTo read the GPL 3.0, read the file COPYING in this directory.\n\nThis program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\nit under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\nthe Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or\n(at your option) any later version.\n\nThis program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\nbut WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\nMERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
