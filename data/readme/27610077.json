Code implementing Fisher Vector CNN will be linked here for completeness when/if the original authors make it available on their website.\n\n\n\nD-CNN [1] on LFW Faces.\n\n* train_gmm.m learns a Gaussian Mixture Model from 'conv5' features.\n* fv_lfw_encoding.m  encodes each LFW image as a Fisher Vector using GMM created by train_gmm\n* diagMetric_train.m trains a pseudo-diagonal metric similar to Fisher Vector Faces [2].\n\n* Run on MATLAB R2014b.\n\n* Part of the data is hosted on private UMass servers (\nweibull: /scratch1/arunirc/FV_CNN_Face/data/all_img_lfw_funneled.mat)\n\n* Please read the .txt files in the tools, models, cnn_models and data folders to obtain the proper data for this code to run.\n\n\n\n1.
