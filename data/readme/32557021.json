  "readme.txt": "Introduction:\nFor theory, see paper at http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.5061.\n\nHere we are providing code for doing the computation for simultaneous method and the sequential method. For the latter, we provide three different ways:\n(a) Solving using Bonmin via AMPL with some data processing with matlab (hours)\n(b) Solving using NelderMead and Gurobi in Matlab (minutes)\n(c) Solving using an Alternate Minimization approach with Gurobi in Matlab (minutes)\n\n* the time in brackets is for solving a weighted TRP of size 7 within the simultaneous method.\n\n\nSystem requirements: \nMatlab 7.11.0 R2010b\nBonmin from COIN-OR\nGurobi\nGurobi-Mex by Wotao Yin available at http://www.convexoptimization.com/wikimization/index.php/Gurobi_Mex:_A_MATLAB_interface_for_Gurobi\n\n*One can also use Cplex and Cplex mex integration (look for Cplexint100)\n\n\nThe code is split among several directories.\nYou will need to appropriately supply data:\n1. Physical graph distances.\n2. Training data with appropriate feature dimensions.\n3. Unlabeled data associated with corresponding nodes on the graph.\n4. For validation of the estimation model, you will need test data.\n\nSetting of parameter C2 is by Cross validation or other equivalent means.\nSetting of the tradeoff parameter C1 is by testing a few values.\n\n\nQuickstart:\n1. Go to folder optimization/Sequential where you can feed your learning data for logistic regression and then perform a weighted TRP.\n\nReference: http://arxiv.org/abs/1104.5061",
