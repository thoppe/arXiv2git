  "README.md": "- Pedestrian Detection\n\nThis code produces the results presented in\n<http://arxiv.org/abs/1409.5209>\non the Caltech dataset (optical flow used; so it doesn't work on the INRIA dataset)\nwith BING as the pre-processor.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf you use this code in your research, please cite our papers:\n\n```\n@inproceedings{PaisitkriangkraiSH14a,\n   author              = {Sakrapee Paisitkriangkrai and\n                          Chunhua Shen and\n                          Anton {van den Hengel}},\n   title               = {Strengthening the Effectiveness of Pedestrian Detection with Spatially Pooled Features},\n   booktitle           = {Proc.

You may not need to compile your own version)\n\n`\tsh> ./mex_optical.sh`\n\n- (b) Run demo.m (This will generate the ROC curve on the Caltech dataset set07, V004. It will download the data first ~400M.)\n\n`\tmatlab> demo`\n\n__WARNING: It may take 2 to 4 hours to get the result, depending on your machine.__ You should see a plot as below.\n\n\n- More Caltech Pedestrian test data can be obtained from\n\n<http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/CaltechPedestrians/datasets/USA/>\n\n- NB: set00-set05 are used for training and set06-set10 are used for testing\n       see <http://www.vision.caltech.edu/Image_Datasets/CaltechPedestrians/>\n\n- The data set is in seq video format. Download MATLAB functions for read/write\n       seq video files from <http://vision.ucsd.edu/~pdollar/toolbox/doc/index.html>\n\n\nThe code has been tested to run on Ubuntu 14.04LTS (kernel: Linux 3.13.0-39-generic #66-Ubuntu SMP x86_64 GNU/Linux),\nMatlab 2013a.\n\n\n![ROC curve](https://github.com/chhshen/pedestrian-detection/blob/master/roc.png \"ROC curve\")\n\n",
