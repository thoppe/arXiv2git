The\napproach is demonstrated here on a number of data sets using a [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/) app.  \n\nThe app can be viewed [here](https://fgam.shinyapps.io/fgam/).\n\nYou can also run the app locally with R using\n```\nlibrary(shiny)\nrunGitHub(\"mwmclean/fgam-app\")\n```\n\nFor more information on Functional Generalized Additive Models, see \n\n[M.
