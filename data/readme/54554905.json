They are the unique minimal sufficient statistics for a sequence of random variables Xt drawn from a discrete alphabet A.\nCSSR (Causal-State Splitting Reconstruction) algorithm is the way to estimate Causal State Model from the data using statistical tests.\nHere is a paper that describes algorithm and the theory in details\n\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0210025\n\nThere are also an improvement, that gives algorithm ability to be even more automatic ( find the best values of some of the parameters for CSSR algorithm, described in the following paper.\n\nhttp://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167865509001597\n\nHere is an extension that allows to determine the statistical significance level of the inferred model.\n\nhttp://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&arnumber=6193099&url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D6193099\n\n\tBy implementing all of these algorithms and techniques the framework will be able to find all the statistically significant patterns from discrete data time series with a minimal input and bias from a user.\n\t\n",
