  "README.md": "DRASLA\n========\n\nDRASLA - Diffusion, Reactions, And Semi-Lagrangian Advection. A C++ code written by [Daniel Groselj](mailto:daniel.grosel@gmail.com).\n\nDRASLA solves reaction-diffusion-advection type equations on a square domain with periodic boundaries. The software is released together with a pseudospectral, two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation solver that can be used to generate velocity field input data for DRASLA.\n\nA detailed documentation of the project may be found in the `doc/` subdirectory.\n\nExamples\n------------\n\nSome examples demonstrating the use of DRASLA are implemented in `examples.h`. Examples demonstrating the use of the Navier-Stokes solver are implemented in `2DTurb/examples2DTurb.h`. \n\nTo run one of the examples, _uncomment_ the call to the corresponding function in `main.cpp` before compiling the program.\n\nArticles using DRASLA\n---------\n\n- D.
