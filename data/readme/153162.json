  "README": "ensemble-community is a small project that provides C and R-project\ninterfaces for community detection with ensemble-based algorithms.\nThese methods are intended to interface with the igraph package.\n\nThe algorithm included in this initial commit is a variant of the \nimplementation described in Massen and Doye's paper:  \n\nCP Massen and JPK Doye. \"Thermodynamics of community structure\".\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0610077.\n\nIn the effdQ.pdf file, there is some basic algebra that allows each\nMonte-Carlo step to be performed quite fast with the appropriate data\nstructures.  Each step scales on the order of the community size.\n\nVersions:\n\n2009-03-17. This particular implementation is a stripped-down lightweight\n            version of code I wrote a while back.  It can get optimal\n            communities on sparse networks of 10K nodes in hours on a\n            2.4 GHz Intel processor. \n\nGoals:\n\n- The next release should have an initial igraph interface as well\n- Create a suite of ensemble and set-based utilites that will aid in\n  analysis. I have created a few in the past, but it will be nice to\n  have ones I can use directly within R.\n- At some point, try to contribute the code/add it to the igraph release.\n",
