  "README.md": "## SoPaper, So Easy\nThis is a project designed for researchers to conveniently access papers they need.\n\nThe command line tool ``sopaper`` can __automatically search and download__ paper\nfrom Internet, given the title.\nThe downloaded paper will thus have a readable file name\n(I wrote it at the beginning because I'm tired of seeing the file name being random strings).\nIt mainly supports searching papers in computer science.\n\n<!-- -This project also comes with a naive server to provide integrated search/read/download experience.  -->\n\n## How to Use\nInstall command line dependencies:\n* [pdftk](https://www.pdflabs.com/tools/pdftk-the-pdf-toolkit/) command line executable.\n* poppler-utils (optional)\n\nInstall python package:\n``pip install --user sopaper``\n\nUsage:\n```bash\n$ sopaper --help\n$ sopaper \"Distinctive image features from scale-invariant keypoints\"\n$ sopaper \"http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.03184\"\n```\nNOTE: If you are not in school, you may need proxy by environment variable `http_proxy` and `https_proxy`,\nto be able to download from certain sites (such as 'dl.acm.org').\n\n## Features\nThe ``searcher`` module will fuzzy search and analyse results in\n* Google Scholar\n* Google\n\nand the ``fetcher`` module will further analyse the results and download papers from the following possible sources:\n* direct pdf link\n* [dl.acm.org](http://dl.acm.org/)\n* [ieeexplore.ieee.org](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org)\n* [arxiv.org](http://arxiv.org)\n\n``Searcher`` and ``Fetcher`` are __extensible__ to support more websites.\n\nThe command line tool will directly download the paper with a __clean filename__.\nAll downloaded paper will be __compressed__ using `ps2pdf` from poppler-utils, if available.\n\n<!--\n   -The server provide:\n   -* RESTful APIs on papers\n   -* Interactive paper reading UI supported by [pdf2htmlEX](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX)\n   -\n   -Command line tool is sufficient to use. If you'd like to play with the server, you'll need:\n   -* Python2 with virtualenv. Python headers are needed (python-dev on debian/ubuntu).\n   -* ghostscript\n   -* libcurl (libcurl4-{openssl,nss,gnutls}-dev on debian/ubuntu)\n   -* xapian (libxapian-dev & python2-xapian on debian/ubuntu)\n   -* pdf2htmlEx installed. See its [download guide](https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX/wiki/Download)\n   -* poppler-utils which provide the 'pdftotext' command line util\n   -\n   -Note: if you need to run server on debian/ubuntu, make sure you do *not* have 'python2-bson' package installed.\n\t -->\n\n## TODO\n* Fetcher dedup: when arxiv abs/pdf apperas both in search results, page would be downloaded twice (maybe add a cache for requests)\n* Don't trust arxiv link from google scholar\n* Is title correctly updated for dlacm?\n* Extract title from bibtex -- more accurate?\n* Fetcher for other sites\n",
