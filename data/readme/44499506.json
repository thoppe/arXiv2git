  "README.md": "# Upsilon\nModule to analize measurements of galaxy-galaxy weak lensing and galaxy clustering.\nCalculation are based on [Rachel's paper](http://arxiv.org/abs/1207.1120v3).\n\nSome of the improvements, compared to previous versions, are:\n\n* The computation of the non-linear power spectrum up to k~1 h/Mpc using the \n        [Coyote emulator](http://www.hep.anl.gov/cosmology/CosmicEmu/emu.html). We may consider the [HMcode](https://github.com/alexander-mead/hmcode) later.\n \n* To compute correlation fuctions, and speed things up, we have incorporated the fast fourier transform ([FFTLog](http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/FFTLog/#motivation)). \n \n* For each set of cosmological parameters, we are now able to compute Non-linear corrections to the real space correlation function, as in Figure 3 of [arxiv:0911.4973](http://arxiv.org/abs/0911.4973). \n\n###Data\nData files for mocks/simulations provided by Sukhdeep are located\nin [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/sukhdeep89/lowz_clustering_lensing).\n\n###Files \n\n``read_data.py`` is used to clean and give the appropiate format to the data provided by Sukhdeep: \nrezised the correlation function gg and gm, and\nthe covariance matrix considering only values up to 70 Mpc (also eliminating the first point).\n\n* input options for simulations, mocks, lowz and/or jackknives \ncan be found in the *Useful_data.py* file\n\n``Upsilon_mock`` contains the main module. \nSome of the option (found in the *Useful.py* file) are: \n\n* *use coyote = F*  (standard option added by Anze in the previous paper), in which the Power spectrum is linear and the correlation function is computed as follows:\n\t* *upsilon_option = 1* : to compute the linear correlation function (Xi)\n\tby an straighforward integration.\n\t* *upsilon_option = 2* : to include an approximation to the non-liear  correlation function (XiCorr) by an straighforward integration.\n\t\n\t\n* *use_coyote = T* : to compute the non-linear power spectrum, and use FFTlog\nfor outputting the correlation function. \n\n* *use_XiAB = T* : to incorporate the 'proper' non-linear corrections to the correlation function.\n\n**wq_files** make all the work!!:\n\n``wq_run.py `` useful to place files in the queue of the bnl/astro cluster.\nThis will produce .Ini files --for CosmoMC-- and wq scripts for the cluster.\n\n* contains an option: *jackknife = True*, but it requires *action = 2* in\nthe .ini file\n\n``wq_run_plot.py``. Once you have the chains in place, run this file to\nget plots: posterior distributions, best fit values -with and without non-linear\nbias- and best-ft values for sigma8.\n\n**write_files** are useful to write the .Ini files (to run CosmoMC),\nto write wq_files (to run in the BNL cluster), to write dist_files (to analyse\nchains using getdist), to write bf_files (bestfit values) and finally to \nwrite plot_files (to plot best-fit values of gg and gm along with data; and\nto plot best-fit for simga8/b1/b2)\n\n``jacknife.py``: plots best-fit values and 1sigma errorbars\nextracted from the jacknives. \n\n###Fiducial values \n* for mocks: h = 0.677, Omega_lamda= 0.692885, Omega_matter= 0.307115, Omega_baryons= 0.048206, n=0.96\n\n* for sims:  Omega_m = 0.292, Omega_b h^2 = 0.022, h=0.69, ns=0.965\n\n* mean redshift: z= 0.267\n\n![](https://github.com/ja-vazquez/Upsilon/blob/master/sigma8.jpg)\n\n###Preliminary results\n\nsee\n[Results](https://github.com/ja-vazquez/Upsilon/tree/master/Results)\n[Notebook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ja-vazquez/Upsilon/blob/master/Upsilon_plots.ipynb)\n",
