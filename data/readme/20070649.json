  "README.md": "KIPAC TeaBot\n============\n\nKIPAC TeaBot is an automatic system which browses through new arXiv astro-ph papers everyday and sends personal suggestions to subscribers. It also sends discussion suggestions to Tea orangizers, and discovers new papers that are authored by KIPAC members.\n\nCurrently this system is open to only KIPAC members. If you are a member of KIPAC and want to become a subscriber, just talk to Yao. There is a plan to expand this service and to open it for all, or to make the system easy to install. If you are interested in this, please contact Yao as well.\n\nCurrent subscribers, please [create an issue](https://github.com/yymao/kipac-teabot/issues/new) to report a bug or to request a feature.\n",
