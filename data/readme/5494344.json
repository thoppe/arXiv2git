  "README": "# BEEBS: Open Benchmarks for Energy Measurements on Embedded Platforms\n\nThis repository contains the Bristol/Embecosm Embedded Benchmark Suite\n(BEEBS).These benchmarks are designed to test the performance of deeply\nembedded systems, particularly with regard to energy consumed. As such they\nassume the presence of no OS and in particular no output stream.\n\n\n\nFor the paper describing the benchmarks and reasoning behind the choice of\nbenchmarks see http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.5174.\n\nFor an example of their use, see http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.6485.\n\n## Compiling\n\nThe strength of the benchmark suite is the ability to run on embedded devices,\nhowever the suite can also be compiled to be executed natively:\n\n    $ ./configure\n    $ make\n\nThis will create a benchmark in each directory in ./src. However, the\nbenchmark suite can be cross compiled for a number of architectures and\ndevelopment boards. Each target needs the prerequisite tools installed:\n\n * STM32F0DISCOVERY\n * STM32VLDISCOVERY\n * Breadboarded ATMEGA328P (with USB to serial programmer)\n * Breadboarded PIC32MX250F128B (with PICKIT2 as a programmer)\n * SAM4L Xplained\n * XMEGA-A3BU Xplained Pro\n * MSP-EXP439F5529LP LaunchPad\n\nCompiling for one these boards will produce executables for that board, which\ntoggle a specific pin at the beginning and end of the benchmark. This allows\nthem to be easily hooked up to other tools for time and energy measurements.\n\n## Using the tests\n\nAll tests provide the functions initialize\\_trigger (), start\\_trigger () and\nstop\\_trigger () to control measurement of the test execution (performance,\nenergy consumed etc). The implementation of these functions should be provided\nin boardsupport.c.\n\nThe number of times each test is run is controlled by the constant\nREPEAT_FACTOR set in the file include/support.h. This should be edited\nas required.\n\n## Versions of the tests\n\nDifferent versions of the benchmarks carry tags, to allow groups to\nagree on a precise version used.\n\nrelease-0.1: This version of BEEBS is described in Pallister, J., Hollis, S.,\n& Bennett, J. (2013). BEEBS: Open Benchmarks for Energy Measurements on\nEmbedded Platforms. Available: http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.5174.\n\nThis is also the version used in Pallister, J., Hollis, S., & Bennett J.\n(2013). \"Identifying Compiler Options to Minimise Energy Consumption for\nEmbedded Platforms\". Available http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.6485.\n\n## Origin of the tests\n\nAll of these benchmarks are derived from other benchmark suites:\n\n * MiBench\n * WCET set of benchmarks\n * DSPstone\n\nAll are freely available for use, but some lack specific license\nprovisions.
