  "README.md": "This is an open source implementation of the Bilingual Distributed\nRepresentations without Word Alignments method described in the\npaper cited below.\n\n\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1410.2455\n\nBilBOWA: Fast Bilingual Distributed Representations without Word Alignments\n\nStephan Gouws, Yoshua Bengio, Greg Corrado\n\n\nWe introduce BilBOWA (\"Bilingual Bag-of-Words without Alignments\"),\na simple and computationally-efficient model for learning bilingual\ndistributed representations of words which can scale to large datasets\nand does not require word-aligned training data. Instead it trains\ndirectly on monolingual data and extracts a bilingual signal from a\nsmaller set of raw text sentence-aligned data. This is achieved using\na novel sampled bag-of-words cross-lingual objective, which is used to\nregularize two noise-contrastive language models for efficient\ncross-lingual feature learning. We show that bilingual embeddings\nlearned using the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art methods\non a cross-lingual document classification task as well as a lexical\ntranslation task on the WMT11 data. Our code will be made available as\npart of an open-source toolkit.\n\narXiv:1410.2455\nSubmitted on 9 Oct 2014\n",
