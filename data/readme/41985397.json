Be suer to use chainer 1.3.2!!  \nThis code does not work in chainer 1.6 (I didn't test with from 1.4 to 1.5)  \n\n## Quick Usage\ninstall Anaconda (https://www.continuum.io/downloads) and then, \n```\npip install chainer==1.3.2\nwget http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/%7Evgg/software/very_deep/caffe/VGG_ILSVRC_19_layers.caffemodel\npython style_net.py -g -1 -c kinkaku.jpg -s style.png -d kinkaku\n```\nif you want to use GPU (recommended). 0 is GPU ID.\n```\npython style_net.py -g 0 -c kinkaku.jpg -s style.png -d kinkaku\n```\n\n## Comment\nThere is a hard coding part. The computation of L_style in forward()\nThis part is coresponding to equation (4) and (5).\nI did not paramatalized it because it would be too complizated. \nI think defalt is fine, but if you want, you can easily change it directly. See L_style in forward().\n\nI recommend to make content image a squared size.\nHowever, you can use rectangular one, but the output will be forsed to a square.\nYou need to resize agian, ex in python,\n```\nfrom scipy.misc import imread, imresize\nimg = imread('filename.png')\nimg = imresize(img,[400,300])\n```\n\nBasic settings is configured, in #Settings part, which is just after the import sentences.\n20000 iteraton will be done. Image is saved every 500 iteration.\n",
