You can extract deltas from delta-CRDT's, and periodically clear them\nout from your datastructures to reduce memory constraints.\n\n## What the heck is a CRDT? ##\nConflict-free, Coordination-free, Commutative, or Convergent datatypes, CRDT's\nare usually formally described as \"join semi-lattices\". Mathematical jargon\naside, CRDT's track causality for modifications to your data. Because of this,\ntime becomes less relevant, and coordination becomes unnecessary to get accurate\nvalues for your data.\n\n## Can you give me an example of one? ##\nI will have a simple explanation here for a basic gcounter and a pncounter.\n\nFor now, I can simply point you to the GCounter code in here.\n\n## Where can I learn more? ##\n*   Strong Eventual Consistency and Conflict-free Replicated Data Types\n    *   A good introduction to the concept of CRDTs: http://research.microsoft.com/apps/video/default.aspx?id=153540&r=1\n*   A comprehensive study of Convergent and Commutative Replicated Data Types\n    *   A survey with references for several popular CRDTs: http://hal.inria.fr/docs/00/55/55/88/PDF/techreport.pdf\n*   Efficient State-based CRDTs by Delta-Mutation\n    *   Talk: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_ewFP-lgyM\n    *   Paper: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.2803v1.pdf\n",
