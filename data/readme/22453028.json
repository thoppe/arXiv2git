It uses tools from the NetworkX graph theory package.\n\n-Instead of calculating the coefficient for different levels of k, the algorithm takes as an argument a priori list of \"rich-club\" nodes.\n\n-We normalize the value of the coefficient by comparing it to the average weighted rich-club coefficent of 100 randomly generated graphs of comparable size.\n\nCitations\n=========\n(1) Julian J.
