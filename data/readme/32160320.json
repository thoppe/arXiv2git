  "README.md": "# Summary\n This package provides substitute functions for `GeoDestination`, `GeoDistance` and `GeoDirection`, which are built-in functions of _Methematica_. This package can solve geodesic problems more accurately with arbitrary precision calculation by designating option `WorkingPrecision`. This package also contains interface to GeographicLib via _J/Link_.\n\n Although this package and [GeographicLib](http://geographiclib.sourceforge.net/) refer to the same paper by Charles F. F. Karney, they differ in the way to calculate. GeographicLib uses functional expansion to calculate elliptic integrals, but this package uses _Mathematica_ built-in functions such as `EllipticE`. Additionally, inverse function of elliptic integral is represented by `InverseFunction`, and `FindRoot` is used to solve the inverse problems numerically. This enables arbitrary precision calculation with _Mathematica_.\n\n At the moment, accuracy of distance calculation is 0.1 m order for `WorkingPrecision->$MachinePrecision` and 0.001m order for `WorkingPrecision->30`. This is much better than `GeoDistance[Method->\"Vintency75\"]`(10000m order), but less than GeographicLib(GeographicLib has 15nm accuracy).\n\n# Installation\n To install the package, \n+ download the zip file,\n+ extract,\n+ move \"Geodesic\" directory to the directory _Mathematica_ can find such as `$UserBaseDirectory` or another one of `$Path`.\n\n# Usage\n In your _Mathematica_ session,\n+ evaluate `<<Geodesic`` to load this package,\n+ use like built-in function e.g. `GeoDistance2[{lat1, lon1}, {lat2, lon2}]`,\n+ or to use GeographicLib, write `GeoDistanceGL[{lat1, lon1}, {lat2, lon2}]`.\n\n# License\n This software is released under the MIT License.\n* Mathematica files: Copyright (c) 2014 Kei Misawa, http://opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php\n* Java compiled files from GeographicLib: Copyright (c) 2013 Charles F.F.
