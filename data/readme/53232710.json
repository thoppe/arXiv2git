Today we are releasing the software and instructions for Windows, Linux and OSX. We have also improved the licensing process and have removed the registration steps completely. *All* future issues *must* be logged against this version, so we encourage anyone who has already installed the software to download the new version.|\n\nAs always, we encourage you to join the mailing list (instructions below) so you will directly receive announcements like this.\n\n## What Is LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A;?\n\nLIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; is a simulation platform developed by the [Quantum Architectures and Computation](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/groups/quarc/) team at Microsoft Research to aid in the exploration of quantum computation. \nLIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; stands for \"Language Integrated Quantum Operations\".  \nA quantum operation is usually referred to as a unitary operator (U) applied to a column state vector (also known as a ket: |>).\nThe \"i\" is just a constant scaling factor, hence the acronym.\n\nLIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; includes three simulators: \n* A full state vector simulator that tracks the detailed evolution of the quantum state\n* A stabilizer simulator based on CHP (Aaronson and Gottesman, http://arXiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0406196)\n* A highly-optimized full state vector simulator for fermionic Hamiltonians\n\nLIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; is available under a [Microsoft Research license](LICENSE.md). \n\n## For More Information\n\nSee the [Microsoft Research project page on LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A;](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/liquid/)\nand the paper, [LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A;: A Software Design Architecture and Domain-Specific Language for Quantum Computing](http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/209634/1402.4467.pdf).\n\nTo stay up to date on what we're doing with LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A;, please watch our repository and sign up for the LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; email list.\nTo sign up, send an email to LISTSERV@lists.research.microsoft.com with a one-line body reading:\n```\nSUB Liquid-news FirstName LastName\n```\nReplacing FirstName and LastName with your first and last names.\nIf you prefer to remain anonymous, you may instead send an email containing:\n```\nSUB Liquid-news anonymous\n```\n\n## How To Cite LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A;\n\nIf you use LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; in your research, please cite it as follows:\n* bibTex:\n```\n@misc{1402.4467,\n  author = {Dave Wecker and Krysta M.~Svore},\n  title = {{LIQU}i|>: {A} {S}oftware {D}esign {A}rchitecture and {D}omain-{S}pecific \n            {L}anguage for {Q}uantum {C}omputing},\n  year = {2014},\n  eprint = {1402.4467},\n  url = {arXiv:1402.4467v1}\n}\n```\n* Text: \n```\nD. Wecker and K. M. Svore, \"LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A;: A Software Design Architecure and Domain-Specific \n    Language for Quantum Computing,\" (2014), arXiv:1402.4467v1 [quant-ph], \n    http://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4467.\n```\n\n## What Can I Do With It?\n\nYou can use LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; to define quantum circuits, render them into a variety of graphical formats, and execute them\nusing an appropriate simulator.\n\nSome of the specific algorithms you can simulate with LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; are:\n* Simple quantum teleportation\n* Shor's factoring algorithm\n* Quantum chemistry: computing the ground state energy of a molecule\n* Quantum error correction\n* Quantum associative memory (Ventura and Martinez, http://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/9807053)\n* Quantum linear algebra (Harrow, Hassidim, and Lloyd, http://arxiv.org/abs/0811.3171)\n\nAll of these algorithms, and many more, are included as samples with LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A;. \nA video of a recent talk  at [IQC](https://uwaterloo.ca/institute-for-quantum-computing/) on the reserach we've done with the simulator is at https://youtu.be/Q6M0ueXLTak?t=1s\n\n## How Do I Get It?\n\nYou can download the LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; executable, libraries, sample scripts, and documentation from this site.\n\nSee the [Getting Started](GettingStarted.md) page for directions on how to download and start using LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A;.\n\nIf you wish to use LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; on a Windows virtual machine,\nsee the [Using LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; on Microsoft Azure](AzureGuide.md) page for directions.\n\n## How Do I Use It?\n\nSee the [users' guide](https://msr-quarc.github.io/Liquid/LIQUiD.pdf) and the [full help documentation](https://msr-quarc.github.io/Liquid/).\nThe help may also be downloaded as a [single file](https://msr-quarc.github.io/Liquid/Liquid.chm), if desired. There is also a [tutorial video](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/video/default.aspx?id=258279) available that will take you through the basics.\n\nNote that this version of LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; is limited to a maximum of 23 physical qubits for full state vector simulation.\n\nIf you run into a problem or have a question, you can [post an issue](https://github.com/msr-quarc/Liquid/issues).\nIf you have other feedback, you can contact the LIQ<i>Ui</i>|&#x232A; team at liquid@microsoft.com.\n",
