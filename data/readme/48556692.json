Solves the following problem:\n\n\"Given the digits 0 through 9 and the operators +, -, * and /,  find a sequence that will represent a given target number. The operators will be applied sequentially from left to right as you read.\"\n\nUsed tutorial from http://www.ai-junkie.com/ga/intro/gat3.html\n\nFor the selection stage, a stochastic acceptance O(1) search is implemented rather than a linear search.
