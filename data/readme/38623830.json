A PDF\nversion is available under `releases <https://github.com/rkdarst/dynbench/releases>`_.\n\nDependencies:\n\n* `networkx <http://networkx.github.io/>`_: standard package for\n  network analysis.  Found in most Linux distribution repositories.\n  Installation is standard with ``setup.py`` or ``pip``.\n* `pcd <https://git.becs.aalto.fi/rkdarst/pcd>`_: My own add-on\n  package for network and community analysis.  Not in any\n  distribution, but can simply be placed in ``PYTHONPATH``.\n\nFor convenience, I have a ``.tar.bz2`` that has the benchmark code,\nplus local copies of ``networkx`` and ``pcd`` included.  This is the\n``dynbench-fulldist-*`` from the corresponding `github releases\n<https://github.com/rkdarst/dynbench/releases>`_ page.\n\n\n\nVersion history\n---------------\n* The original version corresponding to our first paper [1]_ is at tag\n  ``v0.2.0``.  Downloads are at\n  https://github.com/rkdarst/dynbench/releases/v0.2.0.  At this time,\n  future versions maintain compatibility and default options, so the\n  latest version can be used instead.\n\nReferences\n----------\n\n.. [1] Clara Granell, Richard K.
