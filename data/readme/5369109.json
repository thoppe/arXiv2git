To compile,\njust type\n\n$ make\n\nand the Makefile script will finish all the things.\n\nThe main program is the R file \"gen.Tab1.R\" which will output\nan R data package \"reports.Rdata\" from where the predicted\nbinding affinity can be found. These values are used to generate\nthe Table 1 mentioned above. To run it, try\n\n$ Rscipt gen.Tab1.R\n",
