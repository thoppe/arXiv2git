  "README.md": "# Project on Pattern Detection and Recognition using Deep Learning\n\nBy Manasi Khapke, Shraddha Gunjal, Faizan Shaikh\n\n## Introduction\n\nOur main objective of doing this project is to understand the Deep Learning, more specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for computer vision and use them to solve real world problems.\n\nWe demonstrate the use of CNN for two tasks, Detection and Recognition.\n\n\n## Code files description\n\n  * `toy_classifier.ipynb` : Digit Recognition for MNIST\n  \n  * `toy_localizer.ipynb` : Facial Keypoints Detection\n  \n  * `whale_localizer.ipynb` : Right Whale Localizer\n  \n  * `whale_classifier.ipynb` : Right Whale Classifier   \n  \n  * `INC_POSTER.pdf` : Our poster for the project\n  \n## Acknowledgement\n\nThanks to\n\n  * [NOAA Fisheries](http://www.nefsc.noaa.gov/psb/) for the excellent [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/noaa-right-whale-recognition)\n  \n  * [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com) for giving us the chance to test our algorithms\n  \n  * [PICT](http://pict.edu/) college for providing guidance and hardware support.\n   \n Special thanks to \n  \n  * The staff of [CS231n](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) for giving insights to explore the fascinating field of Deep Learning.\n  \n  * our family and friends, without their help and support this would never have been achieved.\n  \n## References\n\n  * Honari, Sina, et al. \"Recombinator Networks: Learning Coarse-to-Fine Feature Aggregation.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.07356 (2015).\n  \n  * Krizhevsky, Alex, Ilya Sutskever, and Geoffrey E.
