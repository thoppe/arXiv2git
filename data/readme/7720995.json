(http://arxiv.org/abs/1112.4624)\n\nopdyn.h, libopdyn.c\n-------------------\nLibrary code for other programs.\n\nsinglerun.c\n--------------------------\n\tUses homogeneous agents and completely connected interaction graph.\n\tInitial distribution of opinions is uniform.\n\tRuns the simulation once.\n\tPrints the popularity array of opinions at every time step.\n\tRequires the GNU Scientific Library (for random numbers only -- can be modified to use another library).\n\tCompile with:\n\tgcc singlerun.c libopdyn.c -std=gnu99 -Wall -lm -lgsl -lgslcblas -o singlerun\n\t\n\tExample use:\n\tsinglerun 30 3 1 -- 30 agents, 3 opinions, confidence bound 1.\n\tsinglerun 30 3 1 1 -- Same as above, with bias to pairwise majority.\n\tsinglerun 30 3 1 2 -- Same as above, with bias to global majority.\n\t\nensemble.c\n---------------------------------\n\tUses homogeneous agents and completely connected interaction graph.\n\tInitial distribution of opinions is uniform.\n\tRuns the system many times, prints the absorption time and absorbing state in each case.\n\tOutput can be captured and analyzed with other programs.\n\tRequires the GNU Scientific Library (for random numbers only -- can be modified to use another library).\n\tCompile with:\n\tgcc ensemble.c libopdyn.c -std=gnu99 -Wall -lm -lgsl -lgslcblas -o ensemble\n\t\n\tExample use:\n\tensemble 30 3 1 100 -- 30 agents, 3 opinions, confidence bound 1, 100 runs.\n\tensemble 30 3 1 100 1 -- Same as above, with bias to pairwise majority.\n\nopdynmarkovQ3d1.m (Matlab)\n-------------------------------\n\tSets up the Markov matrix for unbiased, homogeneous, completely\n\tconnected system with three opinions and confidence bound 1.\n\tPrints all absorbing states and their probabilities.\n\tPlots the probability of state (i,0,N-i) vs. i/N.\n\tPlots the cumulative distribution function of absorption time.\n\tRuns interactively in Matlab.\n\t\nopdynmarkovQ3d1_ver2.m (Matlab)\n-------------------------------\n\tSame as above, but the matrix is set up such that at every time step\n\tany two agents are paired (opinion change does not have to take \n\tplace). This defines a time step as any meeting between\n\tagents, whether they are compatible or not. Included here for\n\tany possible interest.\n\t\nopdynmarkovQ3d2.m (Matlab)\n-------------------------------\n\tSets up the Markov matrix for unbiased, homogeneous, completely\n\tconnected system with three opinions and confidence bound 1.\n\tPrints all absorbing states and their probabilities.\n\tPlots the cumulative distribution function of absorption time.\n\t(There are no polarized absorbing states.)\n\tRuns interactively in Matlab.\n\nopdynmarkovQ4d1.m (Matlab)\n-------------------------------\n\tSets up the Markov matrix for unbiased, homogeneous, completely\n\tconnected system with four opinions and confidence bound 1.\n\tPrints all absorbing states and their probabilities.\n\tPlots the probability of state (i,0,0,N-i) vs. i/N.\n\tPlots the cumulative distribution function of absorption time.\n\tRuns interactively in Matlab.\n\t\nopdynvisual.m (Matlab)\n----------------------\n\tVisualizes the evolution of the system until absorption.\n\tDisplays each agent's opinion, and the popularity\n\thistogram of opinions at every step.\n\tPrints the absorbing state and absorption time.\n\tRuns interactively in Matlab.\n\t\nabsstateprob_C.m (Matlab)\n--------------------------------\n\tRuns the C program \"ensemble\" and captures the output.\n\t\"ensemble\" must be compiled before this program is used.\n\tPlots the probability of absorbing state [i, 0, N-i] vs. i\n\tPrints the probability of consensus and of polarization.\n\tRuns interactively in Matlab.\n\t\nabsstate_ensemble_generate.m (Matlab)\n-------------------------------------\n\tRuns the C program \"ensemble\" for various N,Q,d and bias.\n\t\"ensemble\" must be compiled before this program is used.\n\tFor each run:\n\t\t- Generates data file using the program.\n\t\t- Prints the probability vector of having 1,2,3,...\n\t\t different opinions at absorbing state.\n\t\t- Plots the cumulative distribution function for absorption time.\n\tRuns interactively in Matlab.\n\t\nAuxiliary files\n---------------\nRequired by the programs above.\nopdyn.h\nlibopdyn.c\nBiasToMajority.m\nBiasToMean.m\nUnbiased.m\nissteady.m\n\n",
