  "README.md": "## Action Recognition using Visual Attention\n\nWe propose a soft attention based model for the task of action recognition in videos. \nWe use multi-layered Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) with Long-Short Term Memory \n(LSTM) units which are deep both spatially and temporally. Our model learns to focus \nselectively on parts of the video frames and classifies videos after taking a few \nglimpses. The model essentially learns which parts in the frames are relevant for the \ntask at hand and attaches higher importance to them. We evaluate the model on UCF-11 \n(YouTube Action), HMDB-51 and Hollywood2 datasets and analyze how the model focuses its \nattention depending on the scene and the action being performed.\n\n## Dependencies\n\n* Python 2.7\n* [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)\n* [scikit learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html)\n* [skimage](http://scikit-image.org/docs/dev/api/skimage.html)\n* [Theano](http://www.deeplearning.net/software/theano/)\n* [h5py](http://docs.h5py.org/en/latest/)\n\n## Reference\n\nIf you use this code as part of any published research, please acknowledge the\nfollowing papers:\n\n**\"Action Recognition using Visual Attention.\"**  \nShikhar Sharma, Ryan Kiros, Ruslan Salakhutdinov. *[arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1511.04119)*\n\n    @article{sharma2015attention,\n        title={Action Recognition using Visual Attention},\n        author={Sharma, Shikhar and Kiros, Ryan and Salakhutdinov, Ruslan},\n        journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1511.04119},\n        year={2015}\n    } \n\n**\"Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation with Visual Attention.\"**  \nKelvin Xu, Jimmy Ba, Ryan Kiros, Kyunghyun Cho, Aaron Courville, Ruslan\nSalakhutdinov, Richard Zemel, Yoshua Bengio. *To appear ICML (2015)*\n\n    @article{Xu2015show,\n        title={Show, Attend and Tell: Neural Image Caption Generation with Visual Attention},\n        author={Xu, Kelvin and Ba, Jimmy and Kiros, Ryan and Cho, Kyunghyun and Courville, Aaron and Salakhutdinov, Ruslan and Zemel, Richard and Bengio, Yoshua},\n        journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1502.03044},\n        year={2015}\n    }\n\n## License\nThis repsoitory is released under a [revised (3-clause) BSD License](http://directory.fsf.org/wiki/License:BSD_3Clause).
