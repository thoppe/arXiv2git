Preprint available at\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1204.0562\n\nThe algorithm is implemented in ast_denoise.m and scripts in the subfolder\nbackends. For usage details, type\n\nhelp astlinespec\n\nin the MATLAB prompt. The code also redistributes SpaRSA script for solving\nthe Lasso problem (See http://www.lx.it.pt/~mtf/SpaRSA/) and the CVX and \nSDPT3 packages for semidefinite programming available at http://cvxr.com and\nhttp://www.math.nus.edu.sg/~mattohkc/sdpt3.html\n\n\n\n",
