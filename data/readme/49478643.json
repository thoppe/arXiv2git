  "README.md": "# arXiv Scrape\n\n## Description\n\nThis Python 3 script currently takes a set of arXiv URLs from the abstract page\nand adds the PDFs to [calibre](http://calibre-ebook.com/) while setting the\nmetadata automatically for these attributes (for now):\n\n- title\n- authors\n- tags (categories in the arXiv, e.g. Mathematics & Geometric Topology)\n\nSupport for adding the abstract as a note along with the arXiv ID as a custom\ncolumn is also planned.\n\nIn addition, support for [mutt](mutt.org) and [newsbeuter](newsbeuter.org) is\nalso planned, for those of us who get emailed a lot of preprints or use RSS\n(basically just the author).\n\nThe goal is to make this a true `calibre` plugin, with support for all\nplatforms and no external dependencies.\n\n## How to Use\nMove the script to somewhere on your `$PATH` (run `echo $PATH` if you don't know where that is) and run\n\n`chmod +x exec-scrape.sh`  \n`exec-scrape.sh file1 file2`\n\nOR keep track of what folde  r you downloaded this script into and run this *in the folder containing it*:\n\n`chmod +x ./exec-scrape.sh`  \n`./exec-scrape.sh file1 file2`\n\nNOTE: `chmod +x ..` only has to be run once. It gives the file executable permission. Also note that if you run the script on the same URL, it will not add duplicates to your calibre library.\n\n\n## Dependencies\n- \\*nix System (Mac/Linux or GNU/Linux if you're Richard Stallman)\n- Python 2\n- Beautiful Soup 4 (get it with `pip install bs4`)\nTODO \n- `calibre`\n\n## Contributing\nAny help and criticism (especially criticism) is welcomed. Feel free to send\npull requests. They're *very* appreciated. Any ideas for adding features are\nalso welcome.\n",
