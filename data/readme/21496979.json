  "README.md": "lvm4net\n=======\n\n`lvm4net` provides a range of tools for latent variable models for network data. Most of the models are implemented using a fast variational inference approach.\nLatent space models for binary networks: the function `lsm` implements the latent space model (LSM) introduced by  Hoff et al. (2002) using a variational inference and squared Euclidian distance; the function\n`lsjm` implements latent space joint model (LSJM) for multiplex networks introduced by Gollini and Murphy (2014).\nThese models assume that each node of a network has a latent position\nin a latent space: the closer two nodes are in the latent space, the more likely\nthey are connected.\nFunctions for binary bipartite networks will be added soon.\n\n### References \n- Gollini, I., and Murphy, T.
