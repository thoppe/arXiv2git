  "description": "A small script to check the arXiv for potentially interesting papers, based on keywords.", 
  "README.md": "# Check the arXiv\n\nThis simple script lets you automatically check the [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/) for new potentially interesting papers.\n\nYou choose the list or lists you want to watch (e.g., `hep-th`) and the keywords you are interested in, and `check_arxiv` looks for relevant papers published that day on the arXiv. It can also optionally download the papers in PDF format for you to review.\n\n## Usage\n\nFirst, you should modify the `lists` and `keywords` variables of the script to your desired values:\n\n    lists = [\"hep-th\", \"hep-ph\"]\n    keywords = [\"dark energy\", \"dark matter\"]\n\nYou can define as many lists or keywords as you see fit. Optionally you can also set the `download_pdfs` variable to `True` to automatically download the PDF files to a location given by `download_dir`:\n\n    download_pdfs = True\n    download_dir = \"/home/user/Desktop/\"\n\nAfter this, you can just execute the script normally:\n\n    $ ./check_arxiv\n\nYou may want to use `cron` or a similar tool to automatically execute the script early in the morning every weekday or find more creative uses.\n\nThis is open source software under the terms of the [Mozilla Public License, version 2.0](http://www.mozilla.org/MPL/2.0/). If you have any suggestion please let us know.\n",
