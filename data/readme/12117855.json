It allows users to compose tensor expressions of arbitrary complexity in native C++ code that closely resembles the standard mathematical notation. The framework is designed to scale from a single multicore computer to a massive distributed-memory multiprocessor.\n\nTiledArray is built on top of MADNESS parallel runtime (MADWorld), part of [MADNESS numerical calculus framework](https://github.com/m-a-d-n-e-s-s/madness).\n\nTiledArray is a work in progress. Its development has been possible thanks to generous support from the U.S. National Science Foundation, the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the Camille and Henry Dreyfus Foundation, and the Department of Energy.\n\n### Design Goals\n* General-purpose arithmetic on dense and block-sparse tensors;\n* High-level (math-like) composition as well as full access to low-level data and algorithms, both from C++\n* Massive shared- and distributed-memory parallelism\n* Deeply-reusable framework: everything can be customized, from tile types (e.g. to support on-disk or compute-on-the-fly tensors) to how the structure of sparse tensors is described.\n\n### Example Code\n\nThe following example expressions are written in C++ with TiledArray. TiledArray use the [Einstein summation convention](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation) when evaluating tensor expressions.\n\n* Matrix-matrix multiplication\n\n    ```c++\n    C(\"m,n\") = 2.0 * A(\"m,k\") * B(\"k,n\");\n    ```\n\n* Matrix-vector multiplication\n\n    ```c++\n    C(\"n\") = A(\"k\") * B(\"k,n\");\n    ```\n\n* A more complex tensor expression\n \n    ```c++\n    E(\"m,n\") = 2.0 * A(\"m,k\") * B(\"k,n\") + C(\"k,n\") * D(\"k,m\");\n    ```\n\nThe following application is a minimal example of a distributed-memory matrix multiplcation.\n\n```c++\n#include <tiledarray.h>\n\nnamespace TA = TiledArray;\n\nint main(int argc, char** argv) {\n  // Initialize the parallel runtime\n  TA::World& world = TA::initialize(argc, argv);\n  \n  // Construct a 2D tiled range structure that defines\n  // the tiling of an array. Each dimension contains\n  // 10 tiles.\n  TA::TiledRange trange = \n      { { 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 },\n        { 0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100 } };\n  \n  // Construct and fill the argument arrays with data\n  TA::TArrayD A(world, trange);\n  TA::TArrayD B(world, trange);\n  A.fill_local(3.0);\n  B.fill_local(2.0);\n  \n  // Construct the (empty) result array.\n  TA::TArrayD C;\n  \n  // Perform a distributed matrix multiplication\n  C(\"i,j\") = A(\"i,k\") * B(\"k,j\");\n  \n  // Tear down the parallel runtime. \n  TA::finalize();\n  return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Performance\n\nParallel performance of TiledArray for multiplication of dense square matrices on [Mira](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/mira), an IBM BlueGene/Q supercomputer at Argonne National Laboratory, compared with that of [Cyclops Tensor Framework](https://github.com/solomonik/ctf) and [ScaLAPACK](http://www.netlib.org/scalapack/):\n\n![MM:TA-vs-CTF-vs-SCALAPACK](https://github.com/ValeevGroup/tiledarray/wiki/images/BGQtime_TA_CTF_ScaLAPACK.png)\n\nThis figure was obtained with the help of an award from [the Department of Energy INCITE program](http://www.doeleadershipcomputing.org/incite-program/).\n\nExcellent parallel scalability is also possible for much more complicated expressions than just a single GEMM, as demonstrated below for the coupled-cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) wave function solver. Parallel speed-up of 1 iteration of CCSD solver for uracil trimer in 6-31G* AO basis was measured on (\"BlueRidge\" cluster)[https://secure.hosting.vt.edu/www.arc.vt.edu/computing/blueridge-sandy-bridge/] at Virginia Tech (wall time on one 16-core node = 1290 sec):\n\n![CCSD:UracilTrimer-speedup](https://github.com/ValeevGroup/tiledarray/wiki/images/uracil-trimer-ccsd-blueridge-speedup.png)\n\nThis figure was obtained with the help of an allocation from [Advanced Research Computing](https://secure.hosting.vt.edu/www.arc.vt.edu/) at Virginia Tech.\n\n### Installing TiledArray\n\n#### Dependencies\n\n* **C++ compiler with C++11 support** - Compilers that have been tested include:\n  * GCC 4.7.2 and later, \n  * Clang 3.4 and later, \n  * Apple Clang 5.0 and later, and\n  * Intel C/C++ Compiler 15 and later.\n* **Cmake** 3.0 or later\n* **Eigen** - Version 3.0 and later. http://eigen.tuxfamily.org\n* **MADNESS** - While it is possible to compile MADNESS separately, we recommend compiling MADNESS automatically as part of TiledArray. Compilation of MADNESS requires the following additional prerequisites (see the [MADNESS GitHub page](https://github.com/m-a-d-n-e-s-s/madness) for details):\n  * **Pthreads**\n  * **MPI-2 or MPI-3 library** - [MPICH](http://www.mpich.org), [MVAPICH](http://mvapich.cse.ohio-state.edu), and [Intel MPI](https://software.intel.com/en-us/intel-mpi-library) have been tested. Intel MPI is recommended on x86/Infiniband hardware, but any of these libraries will do. We do not recommend OpenMPI as `MPI_THREAD_MULTIPLE` support is [broken](https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/issues/157).\n  * **LAPACK** and **BLAS** - Serial (sequential, or 1-thread) versions of these libraries is recommended. If you have to use threaded version of these libraries, to avoid poor performance (or even errors) due to non-interoperable threading runtimes it is recommended to configure these libraries to use single thread at runtime before entering the block of TiledArray code.\n  * **Intel Threading Building Blocks** (optional) Version 4.3 Update 4 or later. \n* **Doxygen** (optional) - Used to generate for documentation only\n* **Boost** (optional) - Version 1.33.0 or later for unit tests only\n \n#### Build\n\nTiledArray includes several tool chain files for common platforms. These files contain system specific settings that have been tested on the various platforms. We recommend using one of these \n\n```shell\n$ git clone https://github.com/ValeevGroup/TiledArray.git tiledarray\n$ cd tiledarray\n$ mkdir build\n$ cd build\n$ cmake \\\n    -D CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/tiledarray/install \\\n    -D CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../cmake/toolchains/osx-clang-mpi-accelerate.cmake \\\n    ..\n```\n\nCommon CMake cache variables that you may want to define include:\n\n##### Compiler Variables\n```cmake\n-D CMAKE_C_COMPILER=/path/to/bin/cc\n-D CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/bin/c++\n-D MPI_C_COMPILER=/path/to/bin/mpicc\n-D MPI_CXX_COMPILER=/path/to/bin/mpicxx\n```\n\n##### Option Variables\n```cmake\n-D CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=(Release|Debug|RelWithDebInfo)\n-D BUILD_SHARED_LIBS=(TRUE|FALSE)\n-D TA_ERROR=(none|throw|assert)\n```\n\n##### Library Variables\n```cmake\n-D MADNESS_ROOT_DIR=/path/to/madness/root/dir\n-D TBB_ROOT_DIR=/path/to/tbb/root/dir\n-D LAPACK_LIBRARIES=(semicolon seperated list of LAPACK libraries)\n-D BLAS_LIBRARIES=(semicolon seperated list of BLAS libraries)\n-D BLA_STATIC=(TRUE|FALSE)\n-D INTEGER4=(TRUE|FALSE)\n-D EIGEN_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/eigen3/include\n```\n\n`BLA_STATIC` indicates static LAPACK and BLAS libraries will be perferred. `INTEGER4` indicated the Fortran integer width used by BLAS and LAPACK; if `TRUE` (the default), the integer size is `integer*4`, otherwise `integer*8` is used.\n\nNote, when configuring TiledArray, CMake will download and build MADNESS, Eigen, and Boost if they are not found on the system. Boost will only be installed if unit testing is enabled. This behavior can be disable with `-D TA_EXPERT=TRUE`.\n\n### Developers\nTiledArray is developed by the [Valeev Group](http://research.valeyev.net) at [Virginia Tech](http://www.vt.edu).\n\n### License\n\nTiledArray is freely available under the terms of the GPL v3+ licence.
