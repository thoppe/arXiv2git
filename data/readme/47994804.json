  "description": "R package for Bayesian nonparametric adaptive smoothing with Stan", 
  "README.md": "# bnps\n\nThis repository houses the `R` package `bnps`, which is used for fitting Bayesian nonparametric adaptive smoothing models as described in Faulkner and Minin (2015).  The `bnps` package interfaces with Stan, which is a C++ package for performing Bayesian inference using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (see [http://mc-stan.org/](http://mc-stan.org/)).  Stan can be interfaced with the R package `rstan`, and thus the `bnps` package depends on the `rstan` package to fit models.\n\n## Installation\n1. Install package dependency `rstan` and install package `devtools` using `install.packages` function.  Note that if you do not already have `rstan` installed, you may need to install additional packages such as `Rtools` if using a Windows platform, or `Xcode` if you are using a Mac.  See the [`rstan` prerequisites](https://github.com/stan-dev/rstan/wiki/RStan-Getting-Started#prerequisites) for more information.  If you want the vignettes, you may also need to install the `rmarkdown` package\n2. Load `devtools` using `library(devtools)`.\n3. Install `bnps` from GitHub using either\n  1. `install_github(\"jrfaulkner/bnps\")` or\n  2. `install_github(\"jrfaulkner/bnps\", build_vignettes=TRUE)` if you want the vignette documentation which provides examples of using `bnps`.  Note that building vignettes will make the load take a little longer.\n\n## Vignettes\nThe following vignettes provide some examples using the `bnps` package with step-by-step instructions and R code. \n\n1. **Introduction_to_bnps**\n2. **coal_mine_example**\n\n## References\nFaulkner, J.
