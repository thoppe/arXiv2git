For this, we rely heavily on the picklable_itertools_ library.\n\nFuel is developed primarily for use by Blocks_, a Theano toolkit that helps you train neural networks.\n\nIf you have questions, don't hesitate to write to the `mailing list`_.\n\nCiting Fuel\n   If you use Blocks or Fuel in your work, we'd really appreciate it if you could cite the following paper:\n   \n   Bart van Merrienboer, Dzmitry Bahdanau, Vincent Dumoulin, Dmitriy Serdyuk, David Warde-Farley, Jan Chorowski, and Yoshua Bengio, \"`Blocks and Fuel: Frameworks for deep learning`_,\" *arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.00619 [cs.LG]*, 2015.\n    \nDocumentation\n   Please see the documentation_ for more information.\n\n\n.. _picklable_itertools: http://github.com/dwf/picklable_itertools\n.. _Blocks: http://github.com/mila-udem/blocks\n.. _mailing list: https://groups.google.com/d/forum/fuel-users\n.. _documentation: http://fuel.readthedocs.org/en/latest/\n.. _Blocks and Fuel\\: Frameworks for deep learning: http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00619\n",
