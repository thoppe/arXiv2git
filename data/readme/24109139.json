  "readme.md": "This repo has some experiments for the paper titled \"Generalization Bounds for Learning with Linear, Polygonal, Quadratic and Conic Side Knowledge\" hosted [here](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1405.7764).\n\n###Dependencies:\n\n - CVX: Download the free version from http://cvxr.com/cvx/download/\n\n - barwitherr.m : Download the file from Matlab FileExchange http://www.mathworks.co.uk/matlabcentral/fileexchange/30639-bar-chart-with-error-bars/content/barwitherr.m\n\n###Additional Information:\n\n - Change the nRuns variable at the beginning of the script to a low number (such as 1). If the script is run as is, it can take ~30000 seconds to finish (based on running on a MBP13 with 4 cores).\n\n\n",
