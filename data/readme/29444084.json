Woodhams, Jesus Fernandez-Sanchez, Jeremy G. Sumner. (At time of writing, this is \nsubmitted to a peer reviewed journal.)\n\nIf you just want to use the plugin, download LMM.addon.v<latest version>.zip (under 'releases') and unpack \nas normal for a Beast2 plugin.\n\nAs well as being a Beast2 plugin, this is intended as a reference implementation of the Lie Markov models. \nFeel free to cut and paste code (LGPL v2.1) or to use this as a guide/comparison to your own implementation.\n\nThank you to Remco Bouckaert for extensive help with the Beast2 integration.\n",
