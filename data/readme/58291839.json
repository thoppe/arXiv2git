  "readme.txt": "Robust and Low-Rank Representation for Fast Face Identification with Occlusions\n\nThis is the code to reproduce the results of the paper \n\"Robust and Low-Rank Representation for Fast Face Identification with Occlusions\"\npublished on Arxiv\n\nThe code provides an implementation of the F-LR-IRNNLS and the F-IRNNLS algorithm \nwhich is a fast version of the RRC (\"Regularized robust coding for face recognition\") algorithm \n(with non-negative representation coefficients - but it's easy to adapt it to L2 or L1 coeff.)\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nUsage:\n\n1) add to the path the entire \"FIRC\" folder\n2) run \"Main.m\"\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nMore info:\n\nBy default the experiments reproduce the FIRC results on YaleB dataset with 60% occlusion.\nData of YaleB are provided to reproduce the results of the paper.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1. If you want to run the F-LR-IRNNLS classifier for occlusions set fr.alg = 'f-lr-irc'\n\n2. If you want to run the F-IRNNLS which is the fast version of the RRC algorithm from\nthe \"Regularized robust coding for face recognition\" paper set fr.alg = 'f-irc'.\nMake sure that the settings of the weight function are similar to the ones in RRC.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBSD Licence.
