  "README": "ChiC = The Chicago Construction\n\nThis repository consists of MATLAB codes which help generate the current state of the `storage versus repair-bandwidth tradeoff curves' for exact-repairable regenerating codes for distributed storage systems.\n\nFor details, refer to the following paper(s)\n\n[1] ``New Codes and Inner Bounds for Exact Repair in Distributed Storage Systems'' by S. Goparaju, S. El Rouayheb and R. Calderbank.\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2343\n\n[2] ``High-Rate Regenerating Codes Through Layering'' by B. Sasidharan and P. V. Kumar.\n\n[3] ``Exact-Regenerating Codes between MBR and MSR Points'' by T. Ernvall.\n\n[4] ``Distributed Data Storage Systems with Opportunistic Repair'' by V. Aggarwal, C. Tian, V. A. Vaishampayan and Y.-F. R. Chen.\n\n[5] ``Asymptotic Interference Alignment for Optimal Repair of MDS codes in Distributed Data Storage'' by V. R. Cadambe, S. A. Jafar, H. Maleki, K. Ramchandran and C. Suh.\n\n[6] ``Exact-Repair Regenerating Codes Via Layered Erasure Correction and Block Designs'' by C. Tian, V. Aggarwal and V. A. Vaishampayan.\n\nMATLAB Codes in the Repository:\n\nISITPoints.m: The primary MATLAB function which plots the storage-repair bandwidth inner bound achievable by the ChiC construction as described in [1] (and its extensions). This inner bound is the current best-known for any (n,k,d) distributed storage system and utilizes the ideas from [2]-[6], and other references in [1].\n\nChicagoConstruction.m: This is a subsidiary function called by ISITPoints.m to obtain tradeoff curves obtained by different families of code constructions, two of which - Construction 1 and Construction 2 - are described in [1].\n",
