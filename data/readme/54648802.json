  "README": "\nThis is README file of software MSE_bc v1.01.\n\nThis software is a script compilation for FreeFem++ <http://www.freefem.org/>\nto solve interface cell problems and arrive with coefficients in boundary\ncondition (BC) between porous medium and free fluid.\n\nThe MSE_bc software is licensed under LGPLv3 license.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Contents\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis software currently has one module 2D_MSE_bc_velocity. This module gives the\npossibility to compute the coefficients for BC in two-dimensions (2D) for porous\ncase. It also contains an example solver to employ the developed boundary con-\ndition. If you find this software useful, please cite the corresponding publi-\ncation <arXiv:1604.02880> (arXiv preprint) or <> (under consideration for JFM).\n\nThe module 2D_MSE_bc_velocity contains\nsrc/2D_MSE_bc_Ksolver.edp        -- script to solve for K tensor\nsrc/2D_MSE_bc_Lsolver.edp        -- script to solve for L tensor\nsrc/2D_MSE_solver.edp            -- script to solve a Cavity problem with\n                                    developed boundary conditions\ndoc/2D_MSE_bc_velocity_v1.01.pdf -- explanation of variational formulation and\n                                    script parameters\n\nIn the near future, this software will be extended to three-dimensions and also\nstress boundary condition.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Quick-start\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(Unix)\n\nIn order to run this software, change the current directory to <src> folder of\nthe selected module and, for example, to get solution in 2D for K components,\nexecute in the command line\n# FreeFem++ 2D_MSE_bc_Ksolver.edp\n\nThe results will be plotted on the screen as well as saved to a text file. For\nheadless execution (such as cluster) use\n# FreeFem++-nw 2D_MSE_bc_Ksolver.edp\n\n(Windows)\n\nOpen the script 2D_MSE_bc_Ksolver.edp by graphical FreeFem++ dialogue.",
