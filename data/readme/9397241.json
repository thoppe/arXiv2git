  "README.md": "ARXIV READER FOR MUTT\n=====================\n\nThis is a python script to nicely present [arxiv](http://arxiv.org/) news feed.\nI use it together with the mutt email reader.  It is written using the ncurses\nlibrary :).  It highlights titles whihc are written by ``$ARXIV_AUTHORS`` or\nones that matches a pattern.  It can also fetch abstracts, pdfs or just open\nthe link in your ``$BROWSER``.\n\nConfiguration\n-------------\n\nAdd to `~/.muttrc` file the following snippet:\n```\nmacro index,pager X \"<pipe-message>arxiv_reader.py<enter>Wo\" \"parse message through arxive_reader.py\"\n```\n\nThen when you are over email fro arxiv type X and the scritp will parse the\nemail and list all the titles.\n\nYou should also set the ``$BROWSER`` environment variable, ``$PDFREADER``.  Or\njust change the ``$BROWSER`` and ``$PDFREADER`` variables in the script\ndirectly.  You should also change the ``$DOWNLOADDIR`` variable.  By default\nit is set to ``$HOME/downloads`` and if does not exist it is reset to\n``/tmp``.\n\nHow to\n------\n\nGo up and down with ``j`` and ``k`` keys (or the arrow keys).  Hit ``enter``\n(or ``<space>``, or ``a``) to read the abstract.  If it was not included in the\nemail it will be downloaded from the arxiv web page.  If you hit ``u`` the\npaper's url will be opened using your ``$BROWSER``.  You can also save an entry to\ndatabase: with ``s``, or delete it with ``d`` (sqlite3 database placed in \n``$HOME/.arxiv.db``).  The ``g`` key will get/download the most recent version\nof the paper and ``O`` will open the file in ``$PDFREADER``.\n\nPress ``q`` to close the abstract window or quit the reader.\n\nIf you define ``$ARXIV_AUTHORS`` environment variable titles of matching authors\nwill be highlighted. ``$ARXIV_AUTHORS`` is a white space separated list of names.\n\nIt also hightlights the title if ``$ARXIV_ABSTRACT_PATTERN`` match the title\nor the abstract.  ``$ARXIV_ABSTRACT_PATTERN`` is a Python pattern (can be\nwritten like r\"\" litterals).\n",
