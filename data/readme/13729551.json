  "README.md": "Decaf\n=====\n\nDecaf is a framework that implements convolutional neural networks, with the\ngoal of being efficient and flexible. It allows one to easily construct a\nnetwork in the form of an arbitrary Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) and to\nperform end-to-end training.\n\nFor more usage check out [the wiki](https://github.com/UCB-ICSI-Vision-Group/decaf-release/wiki).\nA great place to start is running [ImageNet classification on an image](https://github.com/UCB-ICSI-Vision-Group/decaf-release/wiki/imagenet).\n\nFor the pre-trained imagenet DeCAF feature and its analysis, please see our\n[technical report on arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1310.1531). Please consider\nciting our paper if you use Decaf in your research:\n\n    @article{donahue2013decaf,\n      title={DeCAF: A Deep Convolutional Activation Feature for Generic Visual Recognition},\n      author={Donahue, Jeff and Jia, Yangqing and Vinyals, Oriol and Hoffman, Judy and Zhang, Ning and Tzeng, Eric and Darrell, Trevor},\n      journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1310.1531},\n      year={2013}\n    }\n\nFor Anaconda users experiencing libm error: it is because anaconda ships with a libm.so binary that does not support GLIBC_2.15, which gets loaded earlier than the system libm. You can fix this error by you can replacing anaconda's libm file with a newer version.\n",
