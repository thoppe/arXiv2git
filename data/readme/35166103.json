The XL-mHG test is an extension\nof the nonparametric `mHG test`__, which was developed by `Dr. Zohar\nYakhini`__ and colleagues.\n\n__ xlmhg_paper_\n__ mhg_paper_\n__ zohar_\n\nIf you use the XL-mHG test in your research, please cite `Eden et al. (PLoS\nComput Biol, 2007)`__ and `Wagner (PeerJ Preprints, 2016)`__.\n\n__ mhg_paper_\n__ xlmhg_paper_\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\n.. code-block:: bash\n\n    $ pip install xlmhg\n\nUsage\n-----\n\n.. code-block:: python\n\n    import xlmhg\n    stat, cutoff, pval = xlmhg.xlmhg_test(v, X, L)\n\nWhere ``v`` is a NumPy array of type \\\"np.uint8\\\" containing only zeros and ones, ``X``, and ``L`` are parameters, and the return values have the following meanings:\n\n- ``stat``: The XL-mHG test statistic\n- ``cutoff``: The cutoff at which the XL-mHG test statistic was attained\n- ``pval``: The XL-mHG p-value\n\nWhat do the ``X`` and ``L`` parameters mean?\n--------------------------------------------\n\n- ``X`` refers to the minimum number of \"1's\" that have to be seen before anything can be called \"enrichment\".\n- ``L`` is the lowest cutoff (i.e., the largest ``n``) that is being tested for enrichment.\n\nA more direct way to understand ``X`` and ``L`` is through the definition of the XL-mHG test statistic. It is defined as the minimum hypergeometric p-value over all cutoffs at which at least ``X`` \"1's\" have already been seen, and which are at or below the n'th cutoff. All other cutoffs are ignored. For `X=1` and `L=N`, no relevant cutoffs are ignored, and the XL-mHG test reduces to the mHG test.\n\nBackground\n----------\n\nFor a discussion of the statistical background and implementation of this test, please see my `Technical Report on arXiv <http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.07905>`_, as well as my `PeerJ Preprint article`__.\n\n__ xlmhg_paper_\n\nCopyright and License\n---------------------\n\nCopyright (c) 2015, 2016 Florian Wagner\n\n::\n\n  XL-mHG is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify\n  it under the terms of the GNU General Public License, Version 3,\n  as published by the Free Software Foundation.\n  \n  This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n  but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n  MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
