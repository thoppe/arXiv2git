The files will uploaded soon... Soon means in the next few months, since with full time work I don't have a lot of time to devote to writing chip-tune music... But it will happen! DR\n\n\nNOTE 3rd Sept 2015\n\nJI notation paper available now at: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1508.07739.pdf\n\nSome example notation text files have been uploaded here.\n\nSome example sequenced files (for input to sequencer_v08) uploaded here\n\nThe music sequencer (MATLAB/Octave code) uploaded.\n\nNote - this sequencer requires a whole bunch of function files to be uploaded too, and I haven't yet succeeded in uploading a whole directory at once!
