  "README.md": "# Is Absolute Separability Determined by the Partial Transpose?\n\nA small collection of MATLAB scripts that supplement the content in the following paper:\n\n[AJR14] S. Arunachalam, N. Johnston, V. Russo Is Absolute Separability Determined by the Partial Transpose? [arXiv:1405.5853][1]\n\nSee Lemma 2 and Lemma 5 in [AJR14] for more information in regards to the MATLAB scripts.\n\nTested with MATLAB 7.10.0 (R2010a)\n\nRequires:\n\n- CVX -- [www.cvxr.com](www.cvxr.com)\n- QETLAB -- [http://www.qetlab.com](http://www.qetlab.com)\n \n[1]: http://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5853\n\n## Usage\n\nIn `ChoiExample.m`, the script determines the eigenvalue range described in Lemma 5 for the Choi Map by using\n`EigenInterval.m`, and also runs the semidefinite program (SDP) described in Eq. (4) of [1] in `EigenRangeSDP.m`. \nA second example of using the reduction map is also given. \n\nIn `IsWernerAbsPPTCheck.m` the script cycles through all Werner -1/(n-1) states and determines if the constraint\nmatrices generated are absolutely PPT. For n = 1...140 this has been checked to be true. Checking for higher \nvalues of `n` is computationally taxing. ",
