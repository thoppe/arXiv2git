  "README.md": "Academic researchers are often forced to write as many publications as possible\ninstead of focusing on quality, public availability and reproducibility of their results.\n\nHence, to help our fellow researchers, we created this application to automatically\ngenerate titles for research papers in computer engineering.\n\nIt demonstrates how to use our Java-based OpenME interface to connect to \nCK (Collective Knowledge) web services with JSON API to generate and\nreturn paper title.\n\nYou can import, build and run it to Android Studio or install it \non your Android-device from Google Play Store:\n\n > https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ctuning.com.researchpapertitlegenerator\n\nAlternatively, you may be interested to check out our long-term initiatives to\nenable collaborative, systematic and reproducible research and experimentation (\nfocusing on computer engineering):\n\n* New publication model with community-driven reviewing of papers and artifacts:\n\n > http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.4020\n\n > http://adapt-workshop.org\n\n > http://ctuning.org/cm/wiki/index.php?title=Reproducibility\n\n* Artifact evaluation for conference and journals (sharing and validating code and data along with publications):\n\n > http://ctuning.org/event/ae-ppopp2015\n\n > http://ctuning.org/event/ae-cgo2015\n\n* Open SDK for collaborative and interactive experimentation:\n\n > http://github.com/ctuning/ck\n\n > http://cknowledge.org/repo\n\nAuthor\n======\n(C)opyright, Grigori Fursin, 2015 \n\nLicense\n=======\n3 clause BSD\n\n(OpenME interface is licensed under LGPL)\n",
