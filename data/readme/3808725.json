  "README": "This is part of a project on a more scalable algorithm for the Stochastic Block Model.\nSee https://sites.google.com/site/aaronmcdaid/sbm and our arXiv document (details below).\nOur paper is under review at a journal at the moment.\n\nThe data files used in our paper [2] in section 6.3 (\"Larger networks\") are very large.  So I have created this Makefile to generate the data locally, and optionally to run our SBM code on it. The source code for our algorithm is also online [1].\n\n\nThree make commands, to be run in order:\n   make generate_data # using the commands in parameters.txt to create folders with synthetic networks in them.\n   make run_sbm       # for each folder that is specified in parameters.txt, run the SBM for 10,000 iterations.\n   make make_table    # print the runtime and number of iterations until the correct result is reached.\n\n\nFootnotes/References:\n\n[1] https://sites.google.com/site/aaronmcdaid/sbm\n[2] \"Clustering in networks with the collapsed Stochastic Block Model\"\n\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3083\n\n@article{McDaidSBM,\n    journal = \"Arxiv preprint arXiv:1203.3083\",\n    archivePrefix = {arXiv},\n    author = {McDaid, Aaron F. and Murphy, Brendan and Friel, Nial and Hurley, Neil},\n    citeulike-article-id = {10457983},\n    citeulike-linkout-0 = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3083},\n    citeulike-linkout-1 = {http://arxiv.org/pdf/1203.3083},\n    day = {14},\n    eprint = {1203.3083},\n    month = mar,\n    posted-at = {2012-03-15 10:10:36},\n    priority = {2},\n    title = {Clustering in networks with the collapsed Stochastic Block Model},\n    url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1203.3083},\n    year = {2012}\n}\n",
