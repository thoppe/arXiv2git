When the collision energy\nincreases, the size of the individual nucleon grows with the inelastic \nnucleon-nucleon cross section and so does the size of the nucleus. \n\nWe will perform our fit at \\sqrt{s} = 23.5 GeV according to the reference, \n[http://arxiv.org/pdf/1108.5379.pdf],\nwhere the gaussian width for the nucleon is 0.473 fm.\n",
