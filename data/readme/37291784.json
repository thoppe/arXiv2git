Channeling occurs when particles enter a crystal aligned\nwith atomic planes or axes. In bent crystals, the particles are \ntrapped between atomic planes and follow the crystal curvature \nbeing deflected. If the particle direction is tangent to a bent\ncrystal plane is reflected to the opposite direction with respect\nto channeling, i.e., it suffer 'volume reflection'. The example \nprovides the physical model for planar channeling and volume\nreflection in bent crystals.\n\n2.GEOMETRY\nThe geometry is a bent Si crystal with three Si detectors placed at\n-1.0 m, -0.01 m and 1.0 m with respect to bent crystal position.\nThe Si detectors allows to measure incoming and outgoing angle\n after the interaction with the Si bent crystal. The\ngeometry is all under vacuum.\n\n3.PRIMARY EVENT\nThe primary events are 400 GeV/c protons at -1.05 m from the\ncrystal with 13.36E-6 rad x 11.25E-6 rad divergence.\n\n4.PHYSICS\nIn the example the physics of channeling and volume reflection\nhas been added to the standard Geant4 physics. The description \nof the used model can be found in the paper 'A model for the \ninteraction of high-energy particles in straight and bent \ncrystals implemented in Geant4' by E. Bagli et al., available\nonline at http://arxiv.org/abs/1403.5819\n\n5.EXECUTION & OUTPUT \nThe executable must be run from within the source directory of the example\nto ensure that it can find the path for crystal data files.\n\nData files for Si crystal interplanar potential, nuclei and electron density\n are stored in a named subdirectory'data'\n\nUpon execution, the 2009_PLB680_129.mac macro will automatically run the\nexample with 1000 protons.\n\nUse\n/xtal/setCurvRadius XXX 0. 0. m\nTo change crystal bending to XXX meters\n\nUse\n/xtal/setSize 1.0 70. XXX mm\nTo change crystal length to XXX millimeter\n\nUse\n/xtal/potfilename data/si110\nor\n/xtal/potfilename data/si111\nTo select the (110) or (111) Si crystal plane of channeling\n\nGPS commands are used for the primary generator.\n\nThe output is the ExExhCh.root file with the TTree ExExChTree\nhas the leaves:\n- angXin : incoming particle X angle at the crystal\n- angYin : incoming particle Y angle at the crystal\n- posXin : hitting X position of the particle at the crystal\n- posYin : hitting Y position of the particle at the crystal\n- angXout: outgoing particle X angle out of the the crystal\n- angYout: outgoing particle Y angle out of the the crystal",
