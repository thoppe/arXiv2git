  "README.md": "# FastCommunity Clustering Algorithm\n\nSlightly modified version of [fastmodularity](http://www.cs.unm.edu/~aaron/research/fastmodularity.htm) that works on Linux.\n\n## Usage\nThis program is rather complicated and requires a specific kind of input,\nso some notes on how to use it are in order. Mainly, the program requires\na specific structure input file (.pairs) that has the following characteristics:\n\n  1. pairs is a list of tab-delimited pairs of numeric indices, e.g.,\n```\n\t\t54\\t91\\n\n```\n  2. the network described is a **SINGLE COMPONENT**\n  3. there are **NO SELF-LOOPS** or **MULTI-EDGES** in the file; you can use\n     the 'netstats' utility to extract the giantcomponent (-gcomp.pairs)\n     and then use that file as input to this program\n  4. the `MINIMUM NODE ID = 0` in the input file; the maximum can be\n     anything (the program will infer it from the input file)\n\nDescription of command line arguments:\n\n* `-f <filename>` give the target `.pairs` file to be processed\n* `-l <text>`the text label for this run; used to build output filenames\n* `-t <int>` timer period for reporting progress of file input to screen\n* `-s` calculate and record the support of the `dQ` matrix\n* `-v --v ---v`\tdiffering levels of screen output verbosity\n* `-o <directory>` directory for file output\n* `-c <int>` record the agglomerated network at step `<int>`\n\n## Algorithm\n\nSee http://www.arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat/0408187 for more information\n\n  - read network structure from data file (see below for constraints)\n  - builds dQ, H and a data structures\n  - runs new fast community structure inference algorithm\n  - records Q(t) function to file\n  - (optional) records community structure (at t==cutstep)\n  - (optional) records the list of members in each community (at t==cutstep)\n\n## Compiling\n\nOn Debian install:\n```\n$ sudo apt-get install build-essential\n```\n\nAnd compile using `make`:\n\n```\n$ make\n```\n\n## License\n\nGNU GPLv2\n\n## Authors\n\n  * Aaron Clauset  (aaron@cs.unm.edu)\n\n### Collaborators\n\n  * Dr. Cris Moore (moore@cs.unm.edu)\n  * Dr. Mark Newman (mejn@umich.edu)\n",
