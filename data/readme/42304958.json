Kok, J. Dahlin, T. B. Schon and A. Wills, *Newton-based maximum likelihood estimation in nonlinear state space models*. Proceedings of the 17th IFAC Symposium on System Identification, Beijing, China, October 2015. \n\nThe papers are available as a preprint from < http://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.03655 >, < http://users.isy.liu.se/en/rt/manko/ > and < http://liu.johandahlin.com/ >.\n\nRequirements\n--------------\nFor the linearization approximations, the program is written in Matlab 2014b. \n\nFor the sampling approximations, the program is written in Python 2.7 and makes use of NumPy 1.7.1, SciPy 0.12.0, Matplotlib 1.2.1, Pandas. Please have these packages installed, on Ubuntu they can be installed using \"sudo pip install --upgrade *package-name* \".\n\nIncluded folders\n--------------\n**linearizationApproximations**\nContains code to recreate a subset of the numerical illustrations in the paper. Executes the proposed algorithm for Newton optimisation using the proposed linearization approximation. For more details, see the README.md file in this folder. \n\n**samplingApproximations**\nContains code to recreate a subset of the numerical illustrations in the paper. Executes the proposed algorithm for Newton optimisation using the proposed sampling approximations. For more details, see the README.md file in this folder. \n",
