  "README.md": "visilens\n========\n\nVisilens is a python module for modeling gravitational lensing\nsystems observed by a radio/mm interferometer like ALMA or ATCA.\nBecause interferometers observe the Fourier components of the\nsky and not actual images, every pixel in an interferometric\nimage is correlated with every other pixel. If you try to make\nlens models using these images, you can get models which are just\nplain wrong, or at least parameter uncertainties which aren't\nestimated correctly. There can be residual calibration problems\nin the data which might lead you to the wrong model.\n\nVisilens gets around this by modeling the interferometric\nvisibilities directly. This lets us take care of those calibration\nuncertainties (from variations in the absolute flux scale, or\nnot knowing the antenna positions perfectly, or residual \natmospheric effects) directly. Visilens marginalizes over these\ndata uncertainties to arrive at models which take full advantage\nof the signal in the data, with accurate uncertainty estimates.\n\nOne of my favorite examples of how this works is shown below. We\ninitially got 1.5arcsec resolution imaging of one particular\nsource, SPT0346-52. The model kept suggesting the structure in the\nupper-right part of the middle panel, and even we didn't believe\nthat could possibly be right - the model predicted three lensed \nimages, but there's only two in the image made from the data. \nWe've since gotten data down to 0.25arcsec resolution, which \nexactly confirms the original model. This tells you that there's \ninformation present in the visibilities which isn't obvious by eye \nin any images.\n\n![SPT0346-52 lens models](/examples/SPT0346-52_models.png?raw=true)\n\nHow to use visilens\n-------------------\n\nThere are a few demos and example usage scripts in the examples/\nfolder, along with the data files to reproduce the models in those\nexamples.\n\nIf you're new to lensing, I recommend playing around with the two\nDemo scripts first, which I hope will help build intuition for how\nthe lens mapping / caustics change as you change the lens properties,\nand how that affects the observed emission.\n\nThe first two example scripts in that folder deal with getting data\nout of CASA's measurement set format and into something more useful.\nThere's an example for continuum data and for spectral line data.\n\nThe next two examples go through the model fitting process, and show\npretty much all the options / features of the code.\n\nIf you need help using the code, please feel free to email me.\n\nAttribution\n-----------\n\nIf you find visilens useful for your work, please cite Hezaveh et\nal.
