Individual conditional expectation plots were introduced in _Peeking Inside the Black Box: Visualizing Statistical Learning with Plots of Individual Conditional Expectation_ ([arXiv:1309.6392](http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.6392)).\n\n## Development\n\nFor easy development and prototyping using IPython notebooks, there is a Vagrant environment included.  To run an IPython notebook with access to your development version of `pycebox`, follow these steps.\n\n1. Make sure [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) is installed (or change the Vagrant provider in [`Vagrantfile`](./Vagrantfile)).\n2. Provision the virtual machine with `vagrant up`.  This will take some time, as it installs `pycebox`'s dependencies.\n3. Access the virtual machine with `vagrant ssh`.\n4. Run an IPython notebook server with `PYTHONPATH=${PYTHONPATH}:/vagrant ipython notebook --no-browser --ip='*'`.\n\nYou should now be able to access the notebook server at `localhost:8000/tree`.\n\n## License\n\nThis library is distributed under the [MIT License](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AustinRochford/PyCEbox/master/LICENSE).\n",
