  "README.md": "Paperscape Map Client\n=====================\n\nThis is the source code for the browser-based client of the <a href=\"http://paperscape.org\">Paperscape</a> map project.\n\nFor details and progress on Paperscape refer to the <a href=\"http://blog.paperscape.org\">development blog</a>.\n\nCompling\n========\n\nThe Paperscape map client is written in <a href=\"http://coffeescript.org\">CoffeeScript</a>, which must first be (trans)compiled into JavaScript code for it to run in a browser. \nSimilarly, the style sheets are written in <a href=\"http://sass-lang.com\">Sass</a>, which must be compiled into CSS.\nWith CoffeeScript and Sass installed, the <i>compile</i> script can be used (on unix-like systems) to automatically perform the compilations.\nOnce started this script will continue to monitor for changes using the `inotifywait` command (from the inotify toolset) unless the runtime command `--single` is specified.\n\nThe JavaScript/CoffeeScript code is split into modules, which are managed and loaded using <a href=\"http://requirejs.org\">RequireJS</a>.\n\nBuilding (deploying)\n====================\n\nThe Paperscape map client can be deployed using the included build script. \nCopy the default build script file <i>build.def</i> to a file named <i>build</i> (i.e. without the extension), and edit the build paths in the new file as appropriate. \nThen give the new build script executable permissions with `chmod +x`, and run it with the command `./build`.\nThe JavaScript minification is handled by <a href=\"http://requirejs.org\">RequireJS</a>.\nThe HTML index file is minified by <i>minhtml/minthml.py</i>.\n\nAbout Paperscape\n================\n\nPaperscape is an interactive map that visualises the arXiv, an open, online repository for scientific research papers. \nThe map, which can be explored by panning and zooming, currently includes all of the papers from the arXiv and is updated daily.\n\nEach scientific paper is represented in the map by a circle whose size is determined by the number of times that paper has been cited by others.\nA paper's position in the map is determined by both its citation links (papers that cite it) and its reference links (papers it refers to).\nThese links pull related papers together, whereas papers with no or few links in common push each other away.\n\nIn the default colour scheme, where papers are coloured according to their scientific category, coloured \"continents\" emerge, such as theoretical high energy physics (blue) or astrophysics (pink).\nAt their interface one finds cross-disciplinary fields, such as dark matter and cosmological inflation.\nZooming in on a continent reveals substructures representing more specific fields of research.\nThe automatically extracted keywords that appear on top of papers help to identify interesting papers and fields.\n\nClicking on a paper reveals its meta data, such as title, authors, journal and abstract, as well as a link to the full text.\nIt is also possible to view the references or citations for a paper as a star-like background on the map.\n\nCopyright\n=========\n\nCopyright (C) 2011-2016 Damien P.
