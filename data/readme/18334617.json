  "README.md": "# Trace norm regularization for the estimation of low-rank tensors\n\nNote: this is made available mainly for reproducibility. Please have a look into the [latest version](https://github.com/ryotat/tensor).\n\nYou can download Matlab scripts that reproduce the results in our technical report [\"On the extension of trace norm to tensors\"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1010.0789) from this page.\n\n## Instructions\n 1. Download and extract. \n 1. Also download the [N-way toolbox](http://www.models.life.ku.dk/nwaytoolbox) (for comparison).\n 1. Open Matlab and type\n```matlab\n test_compare;\n```\n to get Figure 1, \n```matlab\n test_threshold;\n```\n to get Figure 2.\n\n## Results\nYou should get something like this\n\n ![fig1](https://raw.github.com/ryotat/TKML10/master/fig1.png)\n\n## References\n * Nathan Halko, Per-Gunnar Martinsson, and Joel Tropp, Finding structure with randomness: Stochastic algorithms for constructing approximate matrix decompositions, arXiv:0909.4061 [math.NA; math.PR], 2009 (available at http://arxiv.org).
