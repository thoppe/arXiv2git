  "README.md": "This repo contains demo code to run the colorization model described in: \n\nColorful Image Colorization \nRichard Zhang, Phillip Isola, Alexei A. Efros \nIn arXiv, 2016 \nProject Page\n\nWe include demo usage as an iPython notebook, under ./demo/colorization_demo_v0.ipynb. Clone the master branch of the respository using git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/richzhang/colorization.git, cd into the demo directory, run ipython notebook and open colorization_demo_v0.ipynb in your web browser.\n\nThis demo code requires a working installation of Caffe and basic Python libraries (numpy, pyplot, skimage, scipy). For guidelines and help with installation of Caffe, consult the installation guide, Caffe users group, and Caffe Github site.\n\nShould you wish to share your colorizations with us, please email Richard Zhang with subject \"MyColorization\" at rich.zhang@eecs.berkeley.edu. Also contact Richard for any questions or comments. If you find this model useful for your resesarch, please use this bibtex to cite.\n",
