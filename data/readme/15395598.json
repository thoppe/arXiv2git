For\na simple example for both of them, take a look at `example.cpp`.\n\n## compiling\n\nfor compiling just run:\n\n```bash\n$ make\n```\n\nThis will make a `ex` *executable* file and two shared libraries,\n`libtmera.so` and `libidmrg.so`.\n\n### dependencies\n\n1. [armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net/) must be in LIBRARY_PATH. Note that the libraries only compile with armadillo 4 up.\n",
