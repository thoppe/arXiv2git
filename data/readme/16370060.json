Each file\nname indicates the name of the algorithm and the seed that was used to\nsimulate weight sets for testing. The contents of each file give the results\nof repeated runs of the algorithm on combinations of variance of weights and\nnumber of weights. For each run, the execution time is reported. For each\ncombination of variance of weights and number of weights, the squared bias and\nvariance of outcomes across all repetitions is reported. See Murray, Lee &\nJacob (2014) for more information.\n\n\nDescription\n-----------\n\nThis package may be used to test the resampling algorithms implemented in\nLibBi, reproducing the empirical results of Murray, Lee & Jacob (2014). It\nuses the `test_resampler` test command of LibBi; for more information run\n`libbi help test_resampler`.\n\n\nReferences\n----------\n\nL. M. Murray, A. Lee, and P. E. Jacob.
