It is adapted to Polish language but can be easily moved for other languages.\n\nUsage\n=====\n1. Install crfsuite. To download and install visit this: http://www.chokkan.org/software/crfsuite/\n2. Add crfsuite binary file path to system path in a way you would be able to run crfsuite in command line in every folder.   sudo ln -s /home/nlp/Desktop/SentenceSplitter/crfsuite-0.12/bin/crfsuite /usr/bin/crfsuite\n\n3. For first run, go to predict/train folder and run\n   $python train.py\n   Then copy generated period.model to root of period folder beside predict.py\n\n\n4. Put your input in input.pl and run\n   $python predict.py\n\nFinal info\n====\n\nFeel free to use this tool if you cite:\nWolk A., Wolk K., Marasek K., ,,Enhancements in Statistical Spoken Language Translation by De-normalization of ASR Results\", Journal of Computers, January 2016 Volume 11 Number 1, ISSN: 1796-203X, p. 33-40, International Academy Publishing, 2016\n\nFor more information, see: http://arxiv.org/pdf/1511.09392\n\nFor any questions:\n| Krzysztof Wolk\n| krzysztof@wolk.pl\n",
