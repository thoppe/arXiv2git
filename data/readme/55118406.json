  "README.txt": "This project is for SemEval-16 Task6 subtaskA and subtaskB.\n(paper link here.)\nDescription of these two tasks can be found here: http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2016/task6/ \n\nNote that code for subtaskB is almost the same as subtaskA, with slight difference between conv_net_classes.py and conv_net_sentence.py, since the probability distribution after sofemax layer should go through a threshold to perform 3-class classification.\n\nDescription of the project is as below:\n\n1. Requirements:\n\tCode is written in Python (2.7) and requires Theano (0.7).\n\tWe only use the CPU version. If you would like to run this project on GPU, please have a look at https://github.com/yoonkim/CNN_sentence , which this project is based on.\n\n2. Code description:\n\tSE16-T6SA/process4T6SA.py and SE16-T6SB/process_T6SB_4label.py:\n\t\tGoal:\n\t\t\tSimple process on the original dataset provided by SE16-Task6 organizers to generate proper input files for preprocessing.\n\t\tOutput files:\n\t\t\tFor subtaskA, there are three output files - T6SA_stance.pos, T6SA_stance.neg and T6SA_stance.none. \n\t\t\tFor subtaskB, there are two output files - T6SB_stance.pos and T6SB_stance.neg.\n\t\t\tSentences inside the original dataset are separated into different suffix files according to their stance.\n\n\tSE16-T6SA/T6SA_process_data.py and SE16-T6SB/T6SB_process_data.py:\n\t\tGoal:\n\t\t\tData preprocessing and word index vocabulary building.\n\n\tSE16-T6SA/T6SA_conv_net_sentence.py and SE16-T6SB/T6SB_conv_net_sentence.py:\n\t\tGoal:\n\t\t\tModify from sample code of paper Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.5882v2.pdf)\n\t\t\tTraining here.\n\n\tSE16-T6SA/conv_net_classes.py and SE16-T6SB/T6SB_conv_net_classes.py:\n\t\tGoal:\n\t\t\tModify from sample code of paper Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classification (http://arxiv.org/pdf/1408.5882v2.pdf)\n\t\t\tProvide theano specific neural network classes.\n\t\t\nPS: Due to the tight schedule, this README is somewhat curt.
