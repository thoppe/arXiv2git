I cannot guarantee correctness, but the\nimplementation follows the methodology described in the papers closely.\nInitial results were bad enough I consider this a fascinating curiosity but\nnot a viable option for parsing in production. (It's worth mentioning that\nupgrading this to an actual parser would also involve substantial effort -\nand further overhead.)\n",
