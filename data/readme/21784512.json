  "description": "Code to parse OsiriX XML output for ROIs and run a GMM across it", 
  "README.md": "# ROI Calc\n\nGiven a set of data sets in XML (exported from OsiriX) contained in\nmultiple files, where, for each slice:\n\n* one file contains the whole-slice data (\"circ\")\n* N files contain data for different RoIs\n\nWe want to:\n\n* use the whole-slice dataset to identify mean and standard deviations\n  for the distributions representing \"muscle\" and \"fat\"\n* apply those means and std devs to the RoI datasets to identify what\n  proportion of those RoIs are muscle and fat\n\nThis will enable us to determine, against a later scan of the same slice\n(post-intervention), what the effect of said intervention has been on\nintramuscular fat.\n\n## Installation\n\nYou'll need a C++ compiler, and Python (2.6 or later)\n\n* Build `gmm`:\n    * in the `gmm` subdir, run `make` to create the binary\n\n## Notes on assumptions\n\n* We assume that the data distributions for the CIRC dataset include\n  \"bone\" data as a high count of very low-value pixels (i.e. \"black\"\n  pixels) and exclude this peak from the GMM calculation. This is based\n  on a manual process of marking the bone region as black within OsiriX\n  prior to exporting the XML data for the CIRC region.\n* We assume that the distribution of the pixel values for muscle and\n  fat combined are bimodal and heteroscedastic (i.e. there are two peaks\n  in the data, and the distributions have different variances), and that\n  the overlapping distributions are both normal (aka Gaussian)\n\n## References\n\n* A.
