  "README.md": "Rationale\n---------\n\nThis plugin enables [VMD](http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd>) to display\ndynamic molecular data stored in [H5MD](http://nongnu.org/h5md) files.\n\n**H5MD is a structured, binary file format** for molecular data, such as\nsimulation trajectories, molecular structures, or particle subsets with\nassociated data. In addition, there is scope for custom data.\n\n**H5MD is built on the [HDF5 library](http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5)** and\nprovides, among others, multi-dimensional datasets, data compression,\nhigh-performance parallel I/O, and portability.\n\n**H5MD files are created** by these simulation packages:\n\n  - [HAL's MD package](http://halmd.org)\n  - [ESPResSo](http://espressomd.org)\n  - [LAMMPS](http://lammps.sandia.gov)\n    ([h5md dump style](https://github.com/pdebuyl/lammps/tree/start_dump_h5md/src/USER-H5MD))\n\nFind out about more [H5MD-related software](http://nongnu.org/h5md/software.html).\n\n**The H5MD file specification** is hosted at http://nongnu.org/h5md and has\nbeen published originally in\nP. de Buyl, P. H. Colberg, and F. Hofling,\n[Comput. Phys. Commun. **185**, 1546 (2014)](http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2014.01.018>),\nsee also [arXiv:1308.6382](http://arxiv.org/abs/1308.6382).\n\n\nInstallation\n------------\n\nTo compile the plugin, adapt the Makefile and run `make`. This should work on\nany Unix that has VMD and HDF5 installed. For example under Ubuntu you need the\npackage *libhdf5-dev* and the VMD sources.\n\nAlternatively, you may build the plugin with CMake, which requires the\nenvironment variable `VMDDIR` to be set.\n\nTo load the plugin in VMD add the following line to your `~/.vmdrc` (replace the\ndirectory to where you have compiled it):\n\n        vmd_plugin_scandirectory /PATH_TO_SO_DIRECTORY/ h5mdplugin.so\n\nAlternatively you may also load the plugin by linking to h5mdplugin.so in the vmd molfile plugins folder (e.g. under .../vmd/plugins/LINUXAMD64/molfile/).\n\nRemarks\n-------\n\n  - The plugin only works with three-dimensional position data.\n\n  - The files `libh5md.c` and `libh5md.h` form a small library which\n    provides common C routines to read and write H5MD files. This library is\n    licensed under GPLv3.\n  - In order to make full usage of VMD (for example to make VMDs output more \"colourful\") you need to specify the dataset /parameters/vmd_structure in your h5md file, the documentation for this dataset can be found in the file \"Documentation VMD parameters\".\n\n\nExamples\n--------\nExample h5md files can be found in the folder \"samples\".\n![Example of the representation of a h5md file in VMD](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/h5md-user/2013-08/pngf5euRoAsmj.png)\n",
