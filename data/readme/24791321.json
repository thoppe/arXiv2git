  "README.md": "# Programs used in \"Partition identities arising from standard A(2)2-modules of level 4\"\n\nThese are the computer programs used in my PhD thesis: \n\"Partition identities arsing from the standard \nA(2)2-modules of level 4\" (Rutgers University). The \nabstract and the introduction of the above thesis are\nincluded in `thesisAbsIntro.pdf`.\n\nA *partition* of a nonnegative integer *n* into *k* parts \nis a non-increasing *k*-tuple (*p_1, ..., p_k*) of \nnonnegative integers such that \n```\n\tn = p_1 + ... + p_k.\n```\nThe number *n* will be referred to as the *size* of the \npartition. The number *k* is referred to as the *length* \nof the partition. And the entries *p_1*, ..., *p_k* are \ncalled the *parts* of the partition.\n\nA partition *(p_1, ..., p_k)* is said to satisfy a \ndifference condition *[d_1, ...,d_\\{k-1\\}]* if\n*p_i - p_\\{i+1\\} = d_i* for all *i* such that \n_1 <= i <= (k-1)_.\n\nFor example, the partition _(7,2)_ satisfies the \ndifference condition _[5]_. The partition _(11,8,8)_ \nsatisfies the difference condition _[3,0]_, and so on.\n\nSome times, we may use an `*` (asterisk) on an entry of the \ndifference condition to denote *zero* or *more* occurrence \nof that entry. For example, consider the difference \ncondition _[3,2\\*,3,0]_. This may be expanded into the \nfollowing difference conditions: _[3,3,0]_, _[3,2,3,0]_, \n_[3,2,2,3,0]_, ... and so on.\n\n\nThe three partition identities we proposed --- arising from the three inequivalent standard modules of level 4 for the affine Lie algebra A(2)2 --- may be stated as follows.\n\n+ __(4,0)-module__:\nThe number of partitions of a nonnegative integer _n_ into \nparts different from _1_ and such that there is no \nsub-partition satisfying the difference\nconditions _[1], [0,0], [0,2], [2,0]_ or _[0,3]_, \nand such that there is no sub-partition with an odd sum \nof parts satisfying the difference conditions \n_[3,0]_, _[0,4]_, _[4,0]_ or _[3,2\\*,3,0]_\n(where _2*_ indicates zero or more occurrence of _2_), \nis the same as the number of partitions of _n_ into parts \ncongruent to _+-2_, _+-3_ or _+-4_ modulo _14_.\n\n+ __(2,1)-module__:\nThe number of partitions of a nonnegative integer _n_ such \nthat _1_, _2_ and _3_ may occur at most once as a part, and \nsuch that there is no sub-partition satisfying the \ndifference conditions _[1]_, _[0,0]_, _[0,2]_, _[2,0]_ or \n_[0, 3]_, and such that there is no sub-partition with an \nodd sum of parts satisfying the difference conditions \n_[3,0]_, _[0,4]_, _[4,0]_ or _[3,2*,3,0]_ \n(where _2\\*_ indicates zero or more occurrence of _2_), \nis the same as the number of partitions of _n_ into parts\ncongruent to _+-1_, _+-4_ or _+-6_ modulo _14_.\n\n+ __(0,2)-module__:\nThe number of partitions of a nonnegative integer _n_ into \nparts different from _1_ and _3_, such that _2_ may occur \nat most once as a part, and such that there is no \nsub-partition satisfying the difference condition \n_[3,2\\*]_ (where _2*_ denotes zero or more occurrence of \n_2_) ending with a _2_, and such that there is no \nsub-partition satisfying the difference conditions _[1]_, \n_[0,0]_, _[0,2]_, _[2,0]_ or _[0,3]_, and such that there \nis no sub-partition with an odd sum of parts satisfying the \ndifference conditions _[3,0]_, _[0,4]_, _[4,0]_ or \n_[3,2\\*,3,0]_, is the same as the number of partitions of \n_n_ into parts congruent to _+-2_, _+-5_ or _+-6_ modulo _14_.\n\n\nThe codes are divided into three sections, corresponding to \nthe appendices of the thesis.\n\n## A: Maple programs used in the computation of relations\n\n__Directory `maples/rels`:__ \nThe directory containing the Maple codes, used in the \ncomputation of the relations.\n\n+ __File `rels.mw`:__ The Maple worksheet showing\nthe computations.\n\n+ __File `cha.txt`:__ The maple codes to generate\nthe partitions of a nonnegative integer _n_ into\n_k_ parts (based on [[Cha11]](http://support.csis.pace.edu/CSISWeb/docs/techReports/techReport280.pdf)).\n\n+ __File `coef.txt`:__ The maple codes to compute the\ncoefficients of various \"standard monomials\" in various\n\"product generating functions.\"\n\n+ __File `test.txt`:__ Varous maple codes to automate\nthe analysis of various deg 2 and deg 3 relations.\n\n\n\n## B: Computation in noncommutative algebra\n\n__Directory `maple/noncomm`:__\nThe directory containing the computations related\nto straightening out and substitution of non-commuting\nvariables.\n\n+ __File `isom.mw`:__\nThe Maple worksheet showing the verification of the\nisomorphism of the affine Lie algebra A(2)2 in terms of\nthe vertex operators.\n\n+ __File `ini-A22-L4.mw`:__\nThe Maple worksheet showing the computations needed to\nprove the initial conditions for the three level 4 \nstandard modules for A(2)2.\n\n+ __File `npolyio.txt`:__\nThe Maple codes to convert polynomials in non-commuting\nvariables into the list representation and vice versa.\nBased on \n[D.
