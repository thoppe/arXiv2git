  "README.md": "## Abstract\n\nThe Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud diagram is a picture that helps us grasp the contents and the links of globally available data sets. Such diagram has been a powerful dissemination method for the Linked Data movement, allowing people to glance at the size and structure of this distributed, interconnected database. In this paper we present a standalone web-tool that, given a VoID description, can visualize a diagram similar to the LOD cloud. It is novel because the diagram is autonomously shaped from VoID descriptions, and, thanks to DOM manipulations within the browser, several intuitive functionalities are available to interact with the diagram and obtain other relevant information.\n\nCite as\n\n    @misc{1408.6691,\n    Author = {Luca Matteis},\n    Title = { {VoID-graph}: Visualize Linked Datasets on the Web},\n    Year = {2014},\n    Eprint = {arXiv:1408.6691},\n    }\n",
