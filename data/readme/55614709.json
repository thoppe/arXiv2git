  "README.md": "# Person Search Project\n\nThis repository hosts the code for our paper [End-to-End Deep Learning for Person Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/1604.01850). The code is modified from the py-faster-rcnn written by Ross Girshick.\n\n## Requirements\n\n1. Requirements for `Caffe` and `pycaffe` (see: [Caffe installation instructions](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html))\n\n  **Note:** Caffe *must* be built with support for Python layers!\n\n  ```make\n  # In your Makefile.config, make sure to have this line uncommented\n  WITH_PYTHON_LAYER := 1\n  # Unrelatedly, it's also recommended that you use CUDNN\n  USE_CUDNN := 1\n  ```\n\n  You can download my [Makefile.config](http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~rbg/fast-rcnn-data/Makefile.config) for reference.\n2. Python packages you might not have: `cython`, `python-opencv`, `easydict`\n3. MATLAB is required for processing the raw data.\n\n## Installation\n\n1. Build the Cython modules\n    ```Shell\n    cd lib\n    make\n    ```\n\n2. Build Caffe and pycaffe\n    ```Shell\n    cd caffe-fast-rcnn\n    # Now follow the Caffe installation instructions here:\n    #   http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/installation.html\n\n    # If you're experienced with Caffe and have all of the requirements installed\n    # and your Makefile.config in place, then simply do:\n    make -j8 && make pycaffe\n    ```\n\n## Experiments\n\n1. Request the dataset from sli [at] ee.cuhk.edu.hk (academic only)\n\n2. Convert the raw dataset into formatted database\n    ```Shell\n    scripts/make_db.sh /path/to/the/downloaded/dataset.zip\n    ```\n\n3. Pretraining\n    ```Shell\n    data/scripts/fetch_imagenet_models.sh\n    experiments/scripts/pretrain.sh\n    ```\n    Or you may directly download a **pretrained model** from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B67_d0rLRTQYQTJJSTNOX3pEVlE/view?usp=sharing) to `output/psdb_pretrain/`.\n\n4. Training and evaluation\n    ```Shell\n    experiments/scripts/train.sh\n    ```\n    Or you may directly download a **trained model** from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B67_d0rLRTQYeDlXMlc2OGUzeG8/view?usp=sharing) to `output/psdb_train/`, and test the performance with\n    ```Shell\n    python2 tools/test_net.py --gpu 0 \\\n      --gallery_def models/psdb/VGG16/test_gallery.prototxt \\\n      --probe_def models/psdb/VGG16/test_probe.prototxt \\\n      --net output/psdb_train/VGG16_iter_100000.caffemodel \\\n      --cfg experiments/cfgs/train.yml \\\n      --imdb psdb_test\n    ```\n\n## Citation\n\n    @article{xiao2016end,\n      title={End-to-End Deep Learning for Person Search},\n      author={Xiao, Tong and Li, Shuang and Wang, Bochao and Lin, Liang and Wang, Xiaogang},\n      journal={arXiv:1604.01850},\n      year={2016}\n    }",
