  "README.md": "This project contains ideas for a more effective and convenient way of viewing scientific literature in a web-based format.\n\nPDFs are great for imitating paper documents in a widely used digital format.  But a digital display is not paper, and it has the potential to be far more responsive and interactive.\n\n- View current proof of concept [here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/tonyyli/easypaper/blob/master/demo_combined/index.html)\n\nCurrent goals:\n\n1. **Follow citation links easily**\n    - _Trigger_: Click or hover over bibliographic reference (e.g. Smith and Bob 2001)\n    - _Result_:  Tooltip/sidebar with bibliographic info, optional abstract, and link to bibliographic entry (e.g. in ADS or arXiv) is displayed.\n\n1. **View figures, equations, and tables with minimal interruption**\n    - _Trigger_: Click or hover over figure, equation, or table reference.\n    - _Result_:  Tooltip/sidebar containing figure, equation, or table is displayed, with options to resize as necessary.\n\n1. **Look up unfamiliar jargon**\n    - _Trigger_: Click or hover over \"jargon\"\n    - _Result_:  Tooltip with short definition (pulled from some yet-unknown database) and links for more info, or a search link\n    \n-----\n\nNotes on folders:\n\n- `demo_combined`: currently active \n- `demo_html`: originally Tony's\n- `interactive_dm`: originally Devon's",
