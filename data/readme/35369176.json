  "README.md": "# Pedestrian Detection with DPM\nCreated by Tingwu Wang at Sense Time, Beijing and also with Tsinghua University.\n\nIt is a course projects, and sorry we have only a linux port one.\n\n### Citing and based-ons\nThis pedestrian detection is based on the work of DPM and libccv.\nIf you want to cite the original work, please cite\n\n\t@article{girshick15fastrcnn,\n\t\tAuthor = {Ross Girshick},\n\t\tTitle = {Fast R-CNN},\n\t\tJournal = {arXiv preprint arXiv:1504.08083},\n\t\tYear = {2015}\n\t}\n\t@misc{libccv,\n\t\tauthor       = \"Liu Liu\",\n\t\ttitle        = \"C-based/Cached/Core Computer Vision Library, A Modern Computer Vision Library\",\n\t\thowpublished = \"https://github.com/liuliu/ccv\"\n\t}\n\n### License\nThis pedestrian detector is under the MIT License (refer to the LICENSE file for details).\n\n\n### Requirement, software\n1. The libccv dependency.\n```Shell\n-lm -lcblas -latlas -lpng -ljpeg -lfftw3 -lfftw3f\n-lpthread -llinear -lavcodec -lavformat -lswscale\n-lgsl -lgslcblas -lcuda -lcudart -lcublas -L/usr/local/cuda/lib64\n```\nThe cuda, cblas, atlas is what you really need to get. Other packages, you either already have it in Ubuntu, or could easily install using a sudo trick.\n2. OpenCV library with 2.6+\n3. g++ with 4.6 or earlier\n\n### Requirements, hardware\nA GPU that support CUDA-7, or CUDA-6, earlier versions are your own adventures, cause I don't know what will happen.\n\n### Requirements, Data\nThe data is a big issue. Check out the $PEDESTRIAN/data/whats in the data directory.png\nIt lists all the data I used to run the projects.\nTake a look in the source file $PEDESTRIAN/pedestrian/, download what is necessary.\n\n### install\n1. make sure you download all the lib you need.\n2. make the ccv library by \n ```shell\n cd lib\n ./configure && make\n ```\n3. download the data you need, check out the\n ```shell\n pedestrian-detection-thu2015/data/whats in the data directory.png\n ```\n\n4. Using the g++ to compile the source code.\n ```shell\n cd pedestrian-detection-thu2015/pedestrian/\n g++ ...\n ```\nRemember to add the ccv dependency in /lib/.dep\n\nand the ccv lib you just make in the step 2\n\nand the OpenCV lib of course.\n5. The results is stored in the /data/results (or change the path if you want)\n",
