Currently it supports and provides:\n\n* Constructing parametrized Theano operations, called \"bricks\"\n* Pattern matching to select variables and bricks in large models\n* Algorithms to optimize your model\n* Saving and resuming of training\n* Monitoring and analyzing values during training progress (on the training set\n  as well as on test sets)\n* Application of graph transformations, such as dropout\n\nIn the future we also hope to support:\n\n* Dimension, type and axes-checking\n\nSee Also:\n   * `Fuel`_, the data processing engine developed primarily for Blocks.\n   * `Blocks-examples`_ for maintained examples of scripts using Blocks.\n   * `Blocks-extras`_ for semi-maintained additional Blocks components.\n\nCiting Blocks\n   If you use Blocks or Fuel in your work, we'd really appreciate it if you could cite the following paper:\n   \n   Bart van Merri\u00ebnboer, Dzmitry Bahdanau, Vincent Dumoulin, Dmitriy Serdyuk, David Warde-Farley, Jan Chorowski, and Yoshua Bengio, \"`Blocks and Fuel: Frameworks for deep learning`_,\" *arXiv preprint arXiv:1506.00619 [cs.LG]*, 2015.\n    \nDocumentation\n   Please see the documentation_ for more information.\n   \nContributing\n   If you want to contribute, please make sure to read the `developer guidelines`_.\n\n.. _documentation: http://blocks.readthedocs.org\n.. _developer guidelines: http://blocks.readthedocs.org/en/latest/development/index.html\n.. _Blocks and Fuel\\: Frameworks for deep learning: http://arxiv.org/abs/1506.00619\n.. _Blocks-examples: https://github.com/mila-udem/blocks-examples \n.. _Blocks-extras: https://github.com/mila-udem/blocks-extras\n.. _Fuel: https://github.com/mila-udem/fuel\n",
