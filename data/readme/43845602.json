  "README.rst": "Nested Sampling Development Framework & UltraNest\n===================================================\n\nA Pythonic implementation of the Nested Sampling integration algorithm\nfor Bayesian model comparison and parameter estimation.\n\nThis package provides multiple implementations for constrained drawing functions,\nand a test suite to evaluate the correctness, accuracy and efficiency of various\nimplementations.\n\nThe source code consists of three components:\n\n1) A Modular framework for nested sampling algorithms (nested_sampling) and their development\n2) Test framework to evaluate the performance and accuracy of algorithms (testsuite)\n3) UltraNest - A fast C implementation of a mixed RadFriends/MCMC nested sampling algorithm\n\nCurrently implemented algorithms\n----------------------------------\n\nFor drawing uniformly above the likelihood constraint, currently the following\nalgorithms are implemented:\n\n* naive rejection sampling\n* MCMC with adaptive proposal\n* RadFriends/SupFriends (see Buchner, 2014)\n* SVM-based constrainer\n* Galilean (in progress)\n* Hamiltonian (in progress)\n\nTest Suite\n----------------------------------\n\nFor testing the correctness and efficiency of algorithms, multiple algorithms\ncan be run against a set of test problems.\n\nAdditionally to nested sampling implemented here, the following algorithms are evaluated in the benchmark:\n\n* MultiNest (through PyMultiNest)\n* Cuba-based algorithms (through PyCuba)\n\n  * Suave \n  * Divonne (through PyCuba)\n  * Cuhre (through PyCuba)\n  * Vegas (through PyCuba)\n\nThe evaluation of various algorithms can be found at https://johannesbuchner.github.io/UltraNest/testsuite/\n\nUltraNest\n----------------\n\nUltraNest is a fast C implementation of a mixed RadFriends/MCMC nested sampling algorithm.\nIt is documented at https://johannesbuchner.github.io/UltraNest/ultranest/\nYou are welcome to dive into the code (ultranest folder) and implement your \npreferred algorithm.\n\nGetting started\n----------------\n\nHave a look at the file nested_sampling/test/simplenested_test.py\nto build your own combination of nested sampling algorithm components.\n\nYou can run the entire test suite using the testsuite/testbase.py\nbut to only run a part of it create skip_algorithms and skip_problems files and \nrun testsuite/partialtestbase.py\n\nThe documentation is available at https://johannesbuchner.github.io/UltraNest/\nThe source code repository is available at https://github.com/JohannesBuchner/UltraNest/\n\nCiting this work\n-----------------\n\nThe correct citation to use is Buchner (2014) published in Statistics and Computing (`Journal article <http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11222-014-9512-y>`_, `Preprint PDF <http://arxiv.org/abs/1407.5459>`_). \n\nBibTeX::\n\n\t@Article{Buchner2014stats,\n\t  Title                    = {{A statistical test for Nested Sampling algorithms}},\n\t  Author                   = {Buchner, Johannes},\n\t  Year                     = {2014},\n\t  Doi                      = {10.1007/s11222-014-9512-y},\n\t  Eprint                   = {1407.5459},\n\t  ISSN                     = {0960-3174},\n\t  Language                 = {English},\n\t  Month                    = jul,\n\t  Pages                    = {1-10},\n\n\t  Adsnote                  = {Provided by the SAO/NASA Astrophysics Data System},\n\t  Adsurl                   = {http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014arXiv1407.5459B},\n\t  Archiveprefix            = {arXiv},\n\t  Journal                  = {Statistics and Computing},\n\t  Keywords                 = {Nested sampling; MCMC; Bayesian inference; Evidence; Test; Marginal likelihood},\n\t  Owner                    = {user},\n\t  Primaryclass             = {stat.CO},\n\t  Publisher                = {Springer US},\n\t  Timestamp                = {2014.08.20}\n\t}\n\n\nLicense\n------------------\n\nThis work is open source software licensed under GPLv3 Affero (see LICENSE file). \nIf you are interested in a different license, please contact me. \n\n",
