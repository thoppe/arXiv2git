  "README": "* Introduction:\n\n** Heporg is a manager for high energy physics references\n   - heporg downloads pdf file from arxiv.org or inspirehep.net\n   - heporg generates a readable pdf file name (author_arxivNumber.pdf)\n   - heporg generates .org files for storing paper information, \n     including author, abstract, journal, etc\n\n\n\n* INSTALL (only tested on Linux):\n\n** Download the package (preferably using git as follows:)\n\n   git clone git@github.com:tririver/HepOrg.git\n\n** run setup.sh (you may want to have a read before running it)\n\n\n* Usage:\n\n** Heporg is recommended to be used together with a Firefox addon\n   \"viewsourcewith\", use settings -> new, enter editor path as\n   (path to the package)/heporg.py\n\n** Then at the arxiv abstract page (http://arxiv.org/abs/xxxx.xxxx)\n   click the viewsourcewith icon. This click will\n   - generate a record at dir_prefix/org/toread.org\n   - download the pdf file to dir_prefix/pdf/author_arxivNum.pdf\n\n** (Optional) If you want to generate .org file with an alternative name, \n   pass a parameter to heporg.py. In viewsourcewith, the setting is:\n   (setting -> new or edit) Parameters: classic $f\n   where the tag name 'classic' can be replaced with any name you like.\n   Heporg support multiple tags, each tag is a standalone file.\n\n** The .org file is text format thus one can use any editor to view.\n   However, emacs is recommended because the .org file is formatted\n   according to the emacs \"org-mode\". This is actually the original\n   motivation to write the present software.\n\n** Alternatively (without viewsourcewith), \n   one can save the source of the webpage, \n   and in a terminal type \"./heporg.py file.htm\", \n   or \"./heporg.py tag_name file.htm\" to do the same thing.\n\n** Part of the code can be used as parsers of arxiv.org and inspirehep.net,\n   to generate other types of outputs (e.g. SQL type, but currently I don't\n   have a motivation to write a SQL frontend. Text file + grep works well \n   for me).\n\n\n\n* Mechanism:\n\n** heporg.py is the main program.\n\n** parsers.py are parsers for the htm file.\n\n** org_fmt.py format the .org file\n\n** pdf_filters.py applies filters (currently pdfcrop)\n\n* Comments and bug reports are welcome:\n  write to tririverwangyi@gmail.com",
