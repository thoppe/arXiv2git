For the time being, i.e., until I create an R package, to compute r-statistics, type\n\nlibrary(Rcpp)\n\nsourceCpp('num_records.cpp')\n\nFor single samples, rstat(x) returns the r-statistics of vector x. \n\nFor two-sample situations (say x and y), there are several statistics. The simplest idea is to use rstat(x-y). Otherwise, computeUpsDownsTwoSamplesRandomPerms(x,y) returns several quantities from which one can compute r-statistics (TODO: make it more user-friendly).\n\nThis code also makes it possible reproduce results of two submitted papers of mine, http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.01333 and http://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05367, including their plots.\n",
