These skymaps contain spatial distribtion of electromagnetic or neutrino radiation which is proportional to the product of dark matter particles with cosmic-ray electrons, cosmic-ray protons, free electrons, and interstellar gas. This product of dark matter times the matter component of interest is then integrated along the line of sight in order to obtain the projected intensity skymap. More generically, we also provide a python code which can be used to convolve an arbitrary three-dimensional distribution gas, cosmic ray, or free electron densities. Below, we breifly describe each component.\n\nCosmic-ray distribtions are derived using the numerical code Galprop (INSERT GALPROP LINK), under standard assumptions regarding cosmic-ray transport, and assuming several different distributions for the injection of primary cosmic-rays. Free electrons are based on the NE2001 model with corrections to the thick disk scale-height taken from Gaensler et al (2007). For the gas density (2*H2+HI+HII), we employ two models of Galactic gas. The first is based on Dickey & Lockman (1990) with corrections in the inner galaxy due to Bronfman et al (2000), and with the inner 3 kiloparsecs following Ferriere (2007). The second model utilizes velocity data from a the Leiden-Argentine-Bonn 21 cm and Dame et al (2001) surveys commbined with spatial deconvolutions by Nakanishi & Sofue and Pohl, Englemier, & Martin, respectively.\n\nAs described in our paper, Our implementation fo the NE2001 free-electron distribution neglects components which are small outside of the Galactic center region. This should be noted before using this code to integrate against non-centrally peaked distributions.\n\nCode\nCode should be self contained and is written in python. You can download and extract the following tarball to its own working directory. \nYou will also need to have the following python packages installed: numpy, scipy, pyfits. A file \"example.py\" is commented thoroughly and demonstrates most of the functionalty of interest.\n\n\nCode + support files tarball (~250 MB): dmcr_convolve.tar.gz\nWe also display a portion of the example.py code here to demonstrate ease of use (note that most of the below code is just comments).\n```python \n#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# example.py\n# In this script we demonstrate the usage of convolution code from arXiv xxxx.xxxx.  \n# Basically, one can define a function of x,y,z in the Galactic coordinates.\n# (sun lies at (8.5,0,0) with +y corresponding to the direction of positive longitudes)\n# Which is can then be integrated against gas, CR electrons or protons, dark matter, \n# or free electrons.\n# \n# Author: Eric Carlson erccarls@ucsc.edu\n# Affiliation: University of California Santa Cruz\n# Date: April 25 2015\n#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nimport numpy as np\n\n#------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n# Here we define dark matter distributions as the function we are going to convolve against gas along the line of sight\n# In order to support multithreaded convolutions, the functions must be defined as strings which are then written to file.\n# and imported by each thread.
