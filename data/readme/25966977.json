  "README.md": "Modeling the Ophiuchus stream\n=============================\n\nThis repository contains the code used to produce results and create figures for [Spending too much time at the Galactic bar: chaotic fanning of the Ophiuchus stream](http://arxiv.org/abs/1601.06790). The source for the paper itself can be found [in this repository](https://github.com/adrn/ophiuchus-paper).\n\nDocumentation\n-------------\n\nThe documentation is [located here](http://adrian.pw/ophiuchus). The documentation does not describe how to run the science code (that requires a compute cluster or a lot of patience), but does explain code that may be useful for future studies. For example, a class that uses the [Astropy coordinates](http://docs.astropy.org/en/latest/coordinates/index.html) framework to transform into the Ophiuchus coordinates used in this work, and an easy way to load the [Gary potential objects](http://gary.adrian.pw/en/latest/potential/index.html) used in this work.\n\nDependencies\n------------\n\nThe conda or pip installable packages are found in [requirements.txt](https://github.com/adrn/ophiuchus/blob/master/requirements.txt). The following packages are additional dependencies:\n\n* [Gary](https://github.com/adrn/gary)\n* [Biff](https://github.com/adrn/biff)\n\nAttribution\n-----------\n\nTODO: Link to bibtex when posted to arxiv.\n",
