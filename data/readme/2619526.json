  "README": "Wavemoth\n========\n\n\nPlease read the paper [1] for more information about this software.\nNote that this code is *experimental*, and has not yet had its first\nrelease. If you know what you're looking for, go find it. If you are a\nresearcher who just want to speed up your SHTs, you are better off\nusing libpsht until Wavemoth has its first release.\n\nNotes:\n\n - I have not yet renamed things, so earlier names abound in the source\n   (\"spherew\", \"fastsht\").\n - Yes, I intend to clean things up a bit. I believe the code is sound enough,\n   but there's some unused cruft around that should be removed to make it\n   easier for others to enter the source code base.\n\nPlease, send me an email if you are interested in the software. If\nmore than one person comes along I'll set up a mailing list.\n\n\n[1] http://arxiv.org/abs/1110.4874\n\nBuild instructions\n------------------\n\nDepends on:\n    \n    - Python (probably 2.7, perhaps 2.6 may work)\n    - The normal scientific Python stack\n    - The Tempita package\n      (e.g., ``easy_install tempita`` or ``pip install tempita``).\n    - The futures package (e.g., ``easy_install futures``)\n    - ATLAS\n    - FFTW3\n    - libnuma\n\nThen first configure:\n\n    ./waf configure --inplace \\\n        --with-atlas=path/to/atlas\n        --with-fftw3=... \\\n        --with-numa=...\n\nAnd build:\n\n    ./waf install\n\nThen run precomputations. computed on 4 cores:\n\n    python scripts/precompute.py -n 1024 -t 1 1024.dat\n\nand benchmarks, e.g.:\n\n    bin/shbench -r 2048.dat -j 1 -n 10\n\nCopyright & license\n-------------------\n\nlibpshtlight directory:\n  Extract from libpsht: http://sourceforge.net/projects/libpsht/\n  Copyright Martin Reinecke.\n  Licensed under the GNU GPL v.2.\n\nlibidlight directory:\n  Extract from ID: http://cims.nyu.edu/~tygert/software.html\n  Copright Per-Gunnar Martinsson, Vladimir Rokhlin, Yoel Shkolnisky, and Mark Tygert\n  Licensed under the three-clause BSD (see above link for full text)\n\nAll the rest is copyright (2011) by Dag Sverre Seljebotn,\nlicensed under the GNU GPL v. 2 (see COPYING).\n\nNote: I may want to release under the three-clause BSD license in the\nfuture (which would require getting rid of GPL dependencies, such as\noptionally linking to FFTPACK or MKL instead of FFTW3). If you send\npatches, you should either attribute the copyright to me, or we should\nwork out the licensing issue first.",
