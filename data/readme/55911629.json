Visual Studio 2013\n\n2. Cuda 7.5 (**you should install cuda after the installation of Visual Studio 2013 to incorporate cuda vs integration into VS**)\n\n3. OpenCV 2.4.9\n\n4. Boost\n\nSteps:\n\n1. Copy folder \\$3rdparty (http://pan.baidu.com/s/1ge3nKRp) and \\$bin (http://pan.baidu.com/s/1jIyEjKq) to the caffe root directory\n\n2.
