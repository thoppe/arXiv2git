  "README.md": "InverseVIs\n==========\nIn the spirit of reproducible research, this repository contains all the code used in the experiments from: \n\n>\"Data-Driven Estimation in Equilibrium: An Inverse Variational Inequality Approach\" by Dimitris Bertsimas, Vishal Gupta and Ioannis Ch. Paschalidis\n\nA draft of this paper (to be updated) is available from [ArXiv](http://arxiv.org/pdf/1308.3397.pdf).  Traffic data used in the examples is taken from the [repository](http://www.bgu.ac.il/~bargera/tntp/)\n\nAt the present time, the repository is not in working order, mostly because many of the relative paths are incorrect.  I plan to reorganize some of the files and add some documentation soon.  Any pressing questions can be addressed by email to the second author above.  \n",
