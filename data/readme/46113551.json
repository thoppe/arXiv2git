It is  built on  top of  Wien2k,\nwien2wannier, and Wannier90.  In any published papers arising from the\nuse of Woptic, please cite:\n\n   E. Assmann, P. Wissgott, J. Kunes, A. Toschi, P. Blaha, and K. Held,\n   Comput. Phys. Commun. 202, 1 (2016)\n   <http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465515004488>\n   arXiv:1507.04881  <http://arxiv.org/abs/1507.04881>\n\nWhen using additional codes in  conjunction with woptic, do not forget\nto cite their appropriate papers as well.\n\n\nInstallation\n************\n\n0. As a prerequisite,  install Wien2k <http://wien2k.at> and Wannier90\n   <http://wannier.org>.  Wien2k should  include wien2wannier (version\n   14.2 or newer).\n\n1. Get woptic  from  <https://github.com/woptic/woptic>  and  extract.\n   For  the newest  code, clone  the  'master' branch;  for a  stabler\n   version, download the latest release.\n\n2. Configure and compile.   For configuration, copy 'make.sys.example'\n   to 'make.sys' and edit.  To compile, run 'make'.\n\n3. Put  it in your  $PATH.  After compilation, the  woptic executables\n   are in the subdirectory bin/.  It is easiest to add this directory\n   to your $PATH.\n\n4. Optionally, compile the user's guide.  Run 'make doc', resulting in\n   the file 'doc/woptic_userguide.pdf'.\n\n\nLicense\n*******\n\nWoptic  is free  software: you  can redistribute  it and/or  modify it\nunder the terms of the GNU  General Public License as published by the\nFree Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or (at your\noption) any later version.
