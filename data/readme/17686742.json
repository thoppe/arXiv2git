  "README.md": "MixedGraphicalModels\n====================\nUpdated: March 28 2014.\n\nThis repository contains code to reproduce results in \n\nChen, Shizhe, Daniela Witten, and Ali Shojaie. \"Selection and Estimation for Mixed Graphical Models.\" arXiv preprint arXiv:1311.0085 (2013).\n\nLink:\nhttp://arxiv.org/abs/1311.0085\n\nThere are three numerical experiments in the paper\n\n1) The empirical probability of successful recovery (Figure 2) in Section 6.2: (./Figure2_prob_recovery).\n\nCode for reproducing Figure 2 can be found in Figure2.r. Note that this code is computationally intensive and might take weeks to run. A toy example can be found in Figure2_quick.r, where we tune down the number of replicates and parameters of the Gibbs sampler. \n\n2) Edge selection for Gaussian-Bernoulli graphs (Figure 3) in Section 6.3: (./Figure3_Gaussian_binary).\n\nCode for reproducing Figure 3 can be found in Figure3.r. Again, A toy example can be found in Figure3_quick.r. Note that the code does not include methods whose code is not publicly available.\n\n3) Application of selection rule on Poisson-Bernoulli graphs (Figure 4) in Section 6.4 (./Figure4_Poisson_binary).\n\nCode for reproducing Figure 4 can be found in Figure4.r. Again, A toy example can be found in Figure3_quick.r. Note that the code does not include GRaFo by Fellinghauer et al. 2013.\n\n\nFunctions used in the simulation can be found in ./Sources.\n\n----------\nLinks to the authors\n\n\nShizhe Chen http://students.washington.edu/szchen/\n\nDaniela Witten http://www.biostat.washington.edu/~dwitten/\n\nAli Shojaie http://www.biostat.washington.edu/~ashojaie/\n\n\n\n\n\n",
