    "description": "gridcount is an analysis tool for Gromacs that creates 3D (number) densities from molecular dynamics trajectories. Typically, this is used to look at the density of water or ions near proteins or in channels. It provides tools to generate the 3D map in portable formats, 2D cylindrical averages and 1D linear averages (\"density profiles\").",
