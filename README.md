# arXiv2git
Links the [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/) to github repos

Why?

+ It's hard to search for papers like ["t \bar{t} W production and decay at NLO"](http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.5678).
+ Some papers have a lot of links [Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) and it may be hard to find all of them.
+ It builds a database of links for other uses

What?

Citations (links to github) are automatically added (via a Chrome extension) directly to the arXiv site.
